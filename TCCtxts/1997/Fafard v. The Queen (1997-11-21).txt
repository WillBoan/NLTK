JULES FAFARD,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

Reasons for Judgment

P.R. Dussault, J.T.C.C.

[1] Despite the serious conduct I have noted, I would have been prepared not to grant the respondent’s motion to dismiss the appeal on certain conditions, but the appellant, who left the courtroom, clearly refused to accept them.

[2] In the circumstances, and essentially for the reasons given by counsel for the respondent, Mr. Bourgeois, the motion to dismiss the appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed, with $4,000 in costs to the respondent.

“P.R. Dussault”
