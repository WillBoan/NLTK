Tremblay, J.T.C.C.

[1] At issue are two Notices of Assessment concerning the acquisition of two Porsche automobiles purchased during the periods from September 1 to December 31, 1991, and from July 1 to September 30, 1993, respectively.

[2] The first automobile, purchased in 1991, is a 1971 Porsche 911 Turbo. A Notice of Reassessment bearing number 5212771 and dated March 15, 1996, sets the amount payable at $1,413.62 (Exhibit I-1). The appellant company has withdrawn its appeal from this assessment.

[3] The second automobile, purchased in 1993, is a 1987 Porsche 944 Turbo. A Notice of Assessment bearing number 5212095 and dated June 7, 1995, sets the net tax at $2,319.46 (Exhibit I-2).

[4] The respondent agrees to a judgment in the amount of $1,466.24 regarding the Input Tax Credit (I.T.C.).

[5] Concerning the balance of $853.22 ($2,319.46 less 1,466.24), this amount is a charge for vehicle repairs, and the appellant has withdrawn its appeal on this point.

Conclusion

[6] Following the agreement reached, the Notices of Assessment made for the periods from September 1 to December 31, 1991, and from July 1 to September 30, 1993, respectively are returned to the respondent for reassessment with appropriate adjustments with respect to the penalties and interest, each party to pay its costs.
