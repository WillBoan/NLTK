HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR ORDER

Rip J.

[1] This is a motion to determine whether the appellant has a solicitor-client privilege in respect of the documents listed at Schedule "A". The appellant, Copthorne Holdings Ltd., is currently appealing an assessment by the Minister of National Revenue ("Minister") for the amount of $8,748,783.40 under subsection 215(1) of the Income Tax Act ("Act") on account of the tax payable by a non-resident, as well as a 10% penalty in the amount of $8,74,878.43 under subsection 227(8) of the Act for failing to deduct or withhold that tax (and arrears interest) following a determination by the Minister under the General Anti-Avoidance Rule contained in subsection 245(2) of the Act.

[2] On May 14, 2004, respondent's counsel conducted an examination for discovery of the appellant's nominee, Mr. Frank Sixt. During the examination, Mr. Sixt commented that there were various documents that he would have consulted during the period relevant to the appeal. Upon request by respondent's counsel for a copy of the documents, counsel for the appellant claimed that they were privileged. Subsequently, appellant's counsel provided the respondent with a list of the documents, identifying the author, recipient, date and brief subject matter. On reviewing this information, the respondent compiled a list of those documents it continued to seek. This list forms Schedule "A" to these reasons.

[3] The documents, of which there are a number, fall into one of four categories[2]:

A: documents exchanged between the Appellant's Canadian law firm, Stikeman Elliot, and the law firm of Loyens & Volkmaars:

[1, 5, 6, 12, 13, 71, 74, 76, 77, 78, 82, 85, 89, 98, 99, 101, 106, 107, 108];

B: documents exchanged between Stikeman Elliot and third parties:

[2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 104, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113];

C: documents exchanged between Stikeman Elliot and the appellant, or an employee thereof; and documents exchanged among Stikeman Elliot lawyers:

[4, 25, 51, 61, 62, 64, 67, 75, 91, 103, 105];

D: correspondence not directly involving a lawyer:

[7, 8, 39, 49, 54, 87, 100, 102].

[4] Before canvassing the authorities on solicitor-client privilege, I must address a preliminary issue. Many of the documents involve two corporate entities which, according to ppellant's counsel, are associated with the appellant: Concorde Pacific Developments Ltd. ("Concorde Pacific") and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. ("Cheng Kong"). The relationship of each of these entities to the appellant is important in determining whether correspondence passing from the appellant's counsel to an employee or officer at one of these entities is privileged. According to counsel for the appellant, the appellant and Concorde Pacific were at all times "controlled", within the meaning of the Act, by Mr. Li Ka-Shing, and were therefore "related" to each other for purposes of the Act by virtue of subparagraph 251(2)(c)(i). [These corporations are sometimes referred to as the "Li Group"] Appellant's counsel also submitted that "Cheung Kong is a Hong Kong public company of which Mr. Li owned approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding shares, giving him de facto control of Cheung Kong since the remaining shares were widely held". Finally, counsel for the appellant advised that, "[i]n effect, the senior officers and employees of these companies were regarded as employees of the "Li Group", rather than employees of a particular entity or entities within that group".

[5] I am not persuaded that either Concorde Pacific or Cheung Kong should be treated, in effect, as the appellant. The appellant has failed to satisfy me that the companies were sufficiently intertwined as to warrant overriding the fact that they were separate corporate entities. Accordingly, the employees and officers of Concorde Pacific and Cheung Kong cannot be considered to be employees or officers of the appellant for the purposes of solicitor-client privilege: see Mutual Life Assurance Co. of Canada(Applicant) v. The Deputy Attorney General of Canada (Respondent), 88 DTC 6512 ("Mutual Life"), where it was held, based on documentary evidence, that there was a very close relationship between Mutual Life and its wholly-owned subsidiary.

Solicitor-Client Privilege

[6] "Solicitor-client privilege" is defined in subsection 232(1) of the Act and

means the right, if any, that a person has in a superior court in the province where the matter arises to refuse to disclose an oral or documentary communication on the ground that the communication is one passing between the person and the person's lawyer in professional confidence, except that for the purposes of this section an accounting record of a lawyer, including any supporting voucher or cheque, shall be deemed not to be such a communication.

[7] Generally speaking, there are two branches of solicitor-client privilege: litigation privilege and legal advice privilege. The former protects communications between the solicitor, client or third parties made in the course of existing or contemplated litigation while the latter protects all communications between a solicitor and client and third parties that directly relate to the seeking, formulating or giving of legal advice.

[8] As stated by J. Heneghen in Belgravia Investments Ltd. v. R, 2002 DTC 7133 ("Belgravia Investments"), at para 42:

The hallmark of the solicitor-client relationship is confidentiality. The solicitor-client privilege applies to those communications, oral and written, made in the context of that relationship and for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.

[9] In Buffalo v. Canada (C.A), [1995] 2 F.C. 762 (QL) (sub nom. Samson Indian Nation & Band v. Canada), J.J.A. Macguigan and Decary held, at para 8, that:

...it is not necessary that the communication specifically request or offer advice, as long as it can be placed within the continuum of communication in which the solicitor tenders advice; it is not confined to telling the client the law and it includes advice as to what should be done in the relevant legal context.

[10] Significantly, the party asserting the privilege carries the evidentiary burden. To quote again the words of J. Heneghen in Belgravia Investments:

The party asserting the privilege carries the evidentiary burden. The Applicants must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the documents in question are a communication between a solicitor and client that involves the seeking or giving of legal advice, and that the parties intend to be confidential.[3]

Category A Documents

[11] These are documents that were passed between Stikeman Elliot and the law firm of Loyens & Volkmaars, both of which were acting for the appellant. The

following statement, made by J. Saunders in Mutual Life, at page 6512, deals with a similar situation:

Most of the documents are communications and working papers of Ontario lawyers. Many are communications with U.S. persons and a few with persons in Canada outside of Ontario. Most deal with Ontario or Canadian law, or both, but in some documents there are references to the law or to a legal problem in jurisdictions outside of Ontario. In most of the latter cases, local counsel are also involved. The executives of Mutual Life apparently looked to their Ontario lawyers to advise on and supervise the legal matters of the company wherever they occurred. This is a common situation in a business which is involved in international operations. It would, in my opinion, be unduly restrictive if the privilege were to be confined to communications of Ontario lawyers involving only Canadian and Ontario law and the cases cited do not support such a restriction. (See United States of America v. Mammoth Oil Company (1925), 56 O.L.R. 635; Morrison-Knudsen Co. Inc. et al. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, supra; and Gould et al. v. Lumonics Research Ltd. (1981), 59 C.P.R. (2d) 60.)

[12] As was the case in Mutual Life, the appellant here is a large, global enterprise; its activities were not confined to any one jurisdiction, and so it was necessary for it to employ multiple law firms. Based on the above principle, the communications between those law firms-all documents in category A-are privileged.

Category B Documents

[13] These are documents that were exchanged between Stikeman Elliot and third parties (i.e., Concorde Pacific and Cheung Kong, as well as accounting firms, bankers, etc.). The circumstances in which communiqu√© passed between a client's lawyer and accountant attract privilege were considered by President Jackett (as he then was) in Susan Hosiery Limited v. Minister of National Revenue, 69 DTC 5278, where he held, at page 5283:

(a) that no communication, statement or other material made or prepared by an accountant as such for a business man falls within the privilege unless it was prepared by the accountant as a result of a request by the business man's lawyer to be used in connection with litigation, existing or apprehended; and

(b) that, where an accountant is used as a representative, or one of a group of representatives, for the purpose of placing a factual situation or a problem before a lawyer to obtain legal advice or legal assistance, the fact that he is an accountant, or that he uses his knowledge and skill as an accountant in carrying out such task, does not make the communications that he makes, or participates in making, as such a representative, any the less communications from the principal, who is the client, to the lawyer; and similarly, communications received by such a representative from a lawyer whose advice has been so sought are none the less communications from the lawyer to the client.

[14] As for communications between lawyers and other third parties, it is well-established law that these will be privileged only where the third party is found to be an agent of the lawyer or client, or where the lawyer requests the third party's assistance in respect of real or contemplated litigation, as in the case of an expert witness. J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman, and A.W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (1999) ("The Law of Evidence in Canada") states as follows, at para 14.71:

A lawyer, in the ordinary course of his or her practice, utilizes employees such as articling students, law clerks and secretaries. Communication to such agents for the purpose of facilitating the obtaining of legal advice is equally protected. The same can be said about the client's agents, so long as they are employed as his or her agents for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. That is so, notwithstanding that the agent may add something to the communication as a product of his or her own skill. [...] In Goodman & Carr v. Minister of National Revenue[4], an accountant's opinion was sent to the client's lawyer at the client's request. It was held not to be privileged because the agent was not an agent for the client seeking legal advice, but was really offering his own opinion. Because these communications through agents are not normally made in a litigious atmosphere, this situation must be distinguished from the case where a third party is retained to obtain facts or to make a report to assist the client or his or her solicitor in litigation.

[15] Based on the above, only document number 97 is privileged in this category.

Category C Documents

[16] This category consists of two types of documents: those exchanged between Stikeman Elliot and the Appellant, or an employee/officer thereof; and those exchanged among Stikeman Elliot lawyers. All such documents are privileged if they involve the seeking, giving, or discussion of legal advice. Two additional issues arise, however, which are particular to this class of documents:

a) at the relevant time, Mr. Shaw was both counsel at Stikeman Elliot and a director of the Appellant. In what capacity was Mr. Shaw acting as regards the documents involving him?

b) what is the scope of solicitor-client privilege in respect of a large corporation with numerous officers and employees?

Mr. Shaw

[17] A similar situation is discussed in The Law of Evidence in Canada (1999), at para 14.72:

In Presswood v. International Chemalloy Corp., an inspector appointed pursuant to the Ontario Business Corporations Act had wide powers of examination of the company's affairs. However, the company claimed privileged from examination for certain documents that were in the possession of the company's solicitor, who was also a director of the corporation. The company argued that the particular provision of the Ontario Business Corporations Act did not override the privilege for communications between a solicitor and client. The Court recognized the fact that the company solicitor in this case was also a director and stated that any work done for the employer in a capacity other than that of solicitor could not be the subject of any legal professional privilege. Bearing this in mind, the Court held that the company could claim privilege for any particular letter, document or record in the files of the solicitor/director. Any disputes as to whether the privilege applied to a particular document were to be referred to the Master. Thus, the character of the activity carried on by the individual in question must be scrutinized to determine its nature. If the solicitor has information as a result of communications in his or her professional capacity as a lawyer, privilege will attach, but not otherwise.

[18] The principle was expressed concisely by J. Saunders in Mutual Life, at page 6513:

[...] The communications are privileged if they concern the employee's function as a lawyer and are not privileged if the lawyer is performing a business or other function. [...]

[19] Upon review of the relevant case law and of the documents involving Mr. Shaw, I am satisfied that all were made in respect of Mr. Shaw's role as legal counsel.

Scope of Privilege regarding Employees

[20] The Law of Evidence in Canada states as follows, at para 14.74

In Canada, there has been broad protection for confidential communications emanating from an employee, regardless of the level of his or her position in the corporate hierarchy, provided the objective was to obtain legal advice. Moreover, as long as the statement was made generally in the course of his or her employment, no specific inquiry needed to be made of the subject-matter to ensure that it fell squarely within the scope of his or her duties. For the most part, the issue has been treated by Canadian courts as one coming within the agency theory of privilege; that is, an employee can be engaged by the corporate client to pass on information to solicitors for the purpose of receiving legal advice.[5]

[21] All of the documents in category C were exchanged among the appellant's lawyers, or between the appellant's solicitors and employees/officers. All involve the discussion, seeking or dissemination of legal advice, and hence, all are privileged.

Category D Documents

[22] All of these documents were exchanged amongst third parties, with appellant's counsel receiving a carbon copy of some of the documents. But for document number 102, even where the Appellant's counsel is carbon copied, the documents do not involve the seeking or giving of legal advice. In the result, document number 102 is privileged, the rest are not.

Costs shall be awarded in the cause.
