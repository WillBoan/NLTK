Docket: 2004-2139(GST)I

BETWEEN:

CITY OF AIRDRIE,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Teskey, J.

[1] The Appellant appeals an assessment of tax, Notice of which bears number 10CT-0318-1140-0131 and is dated February 11, 2004, made pursuant to the Goods and Services (GST) provisions of the Excise Tax Act (the "Act").

Issues

[2] The issues are:

(a) Whether the Appellant made a supply by installing water and sewer lines to service lands to be purchased by The Board of Trustees of the Calgary Separate School District No. 1 (the "Board")?;

(b) If a supply was made, was it an exempt supply or a taxable supply?; and

(c) If the supply was an exempt supply, has the Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") properly disallowed claimed input tax credits (ITC) and allowed a rebate of 57.14%?

Facts

[3] The Minister, when making the assessment, assumed 18 separate facts that were reproduced as paragraph 6, subparagraphs a) to r) in the Reply to the Notice of Appeal, all of which were admitted by the Appellant and read as follows:

a) at all material times the Appellant was a municipal corporation located in the province of Alberta;

b) the Appellant registered under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, as amended (the "Act") effective January 1, 1991, and was assigned Registration number 10692 9961 RT0001;

c) the Appellant was required to file GST returns on a monthly basis;

d) at all material times, the Appellant provided taxable and exempt supplies;

e) as a municipality, the Appellant supplies various services including the provision of water and the disposal of sewage;

f) at all material times, the Appellant claimed the municipal rebate of 57.14% on the GST paid;

g) the Board acquired a four acre portion (the "School Lands") of a larger subdivision area, from Pensionfund Realty Limited, for the purposes of constructing and operating a junior/senior separate high school on these School Lands;

h) as a condition of the subdivision which created the School Lands, the Appellant's subdivision approving authority required that the Underground Utility Lines be constructed and installed to service the School Lands and that would as well, service the adjacent and as yet undeveloped lands;

i) in the Agreement, the Board agreed to fund and pay for the cost of construction and installation of the Underground Utility Lines (excepting only the costs of constructing oversize Underground Utility Lines, which costs would be paid by the Appellant) on the understanding that the Appellant would provide assistance to the Board in the recovery of such costs from the balance of the subdivision lands benefiting from the Underground Utility Lines as and when the development of such lands occurred;

j) Pursuant to the Agreement, the Appellant put the contract out to public tender and was responsible for the costs of a survey, inspection, field supervision and the coordination of construction services relating to the installation of the Underground Utility Lines;

k) pursuant to the Agreement, the Appellant was solely responsible for administering all payments due to the contractor including provisions for all builders' liens or other holdbacks as were required by law or were permitted under the contract;

l) the Appellant awarded and entered into a contract with Perth Construction Ltd. respecting the construction and installation of the Underground Utility Lines;

m) the Appellant paid $359,803.79 including GST of $23,538.57 to Perth Construction Ltd. respecting the Underground Utility Lines (the "Costs");

n) on or about the last monthly filing periods in 1998, the Appellant claimed municipal rebates totaling $13,450.60 respecting the Costs;

o) pursuant to the Agreement and in order to be reimbursed for its payment of the Costs, on November 5, 1998, the Appellant invoiced the Board for $365,001.85 respecting the construction and installation of the Underground Utility Lines;

p) in filing its GST return for the month ending February 29, 2000, the Appellant reported a credit adjustment to ITCs of $23,538.57 and a debit adjustment to rebates of $13,450.60 respecting the Costs;

q) the Appellant filed monthly GST returns and reported taxable supplies totalling $3,587,025 for the Assessment Period, as detailed in Schedule "A";

r) in filing its GST returns, the Appellant reported GST of $199,150.02, claimed ITCs totalling $305,042.25 and claimed Rebates totalling $601,878.08, for the Assessment Period, as detailed in Schedule "A";

[4] Paragraph 6 had two further subparagraphs labelled s) and t), which ought not to have been there, as they were the issues that I have to decide. They read as follows:

s) the Appellant overstated ITCs by $23,538.57 for the Assessment Period, as detailed in Schedule "B"; and

t) the Appellant understated Rebates by $13,449.94 for the Assessment Period, as detailed in Schedule "B";

[5] The Appellant entered into a formal written agreement with the Board on the 15th of July, 1998, which was entered as Exhibit A-1.

[6] This agreement says that, in essence, in order for the Board to acquire a parcel of land, the Appellant required the land to be serviced with sewer and water. The Board agreed to fund the servicing but not any oversizing. The Appellant proceeded to service the school lands with oversized services. The town agreed to charge the other benefited lands when developed with the costs of the services and to reimburse the Board if and when the costs are collected.

[7] Attached hereto is a copy of the above-mentioned agreement, marked as Schedule "A".

[8] The Appellant proceeded, pursuant to the agreement, to have the lands serviced with sewer and water lines.

[9] On May 29, the Appellant's employees prepared a request to have an invoice sent to the Board for progress payments as approved by its engineers.

[10] As a result of the invoice requisition, the Appellant sent to the Board an invoice that simply stated "Ridgegate Trunk Mains" for $341,123.22 plus GST of $23,878.63, for a total of $365,001.90, which the Board promptly paid in full. (The invoice date is obviously wrong as it predates the agreement and was paid on November 18, 1998).

Analysis

[11] The Respondent argues that the installation of the water and sewer services pursuant to the written agreement was en exempt supply and therefore the Appellant should not have charged the Board GST in the amount of $23,538.57, thus the Appellant cannot claim the $23,538.57 as ITCs. It is up to the Board to apply for a rebate of GST paid in error. The Appellant is entitled to a rebate of 57.14% of the costs, which has been allowed and therefore the assessment stands.

[12] The Appellant argues that, pursuant to the agreement, there was no supply to the Board of sewer and water mains, only an accommodation as ownership of the services did not pass to the Board. In essence, the agreement was a temporary financing arrangement and the $341,123.27 was for processing the terms of the agreement.

[13] I reject the Appellant's position.

[14] The agreement speaks for itself. The Appellant hired a contractor, the services were installed, the Board paid for the services (less oversizing). This allowed the Board to obtain title to the property, build a school thereon and have the use of the water and sewer services. The Board may or may not get reimbursed for the cost of the sewer and water main installation and if it does get reimbursed, when?

[15] Part VI of Schedule V of the Act, under the heading "Public Sector Bodies", is the section of that act that gives a general exemption for supplies by public institutions. Section 22 thereof reads as follows:

22. [Water and sewage systems] - A supply of a service, made by a municipality or by an organization that operates a water distribution, sewerage or drainage system and that is designated by the Minister to be a municipality for the purposes of this section, of installing, repairing, maintaining or interrupting the operation of a water distribution, sewerage or drainage system.

[16] Thus, the agreement was for a supply and the supply was exempt.

[17] The Act, in section 123, defines "taxable supply" "commercial activity" and "exempt supply". There is no need to go through these provisions.

[18] My colleague, Justice Lamarre Proulx, in Montr√©al (City) v. Canada, [2003] T.C.J. No. 432 (Q.L.), 2003 TCC 534, held that a taxpayer cannot claim ITCs on an exempt supply. I agree.

[19] The Appellant argued that the assessment is contrary to Policy Statement P-168R. This statement deals with a municipality that is selling serviced lots to the public. Herein, there are no lots owned by the municipality and thus, the policy has no bearing on this appeal whatsoever.

[20] It was common ground that, if I found the agreement constituted an exempt supply, then the 57.14% rebate, as provided by the Act, was correct.

[21] For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

Signed at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 14th day of January, 2005.
