[OFFICIAL ENGLISH TRANSLATION]

AMENDED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Judge Bédard

[1] The appellants (Jean-François Blais and Christiane Auray-Blais) in appeals numbered 2004-206(IT)I and 2004-208(IT)I respectively had raised the following issue[1] solely in respect of the 1996 and 1997 taxation years: the appellants contended that, under subsection 37(1) of the Income Tax Act (the “Act”), they could carry forward to subsequent years the SR&ED expenditures incurred by the partnership in a taxation year.

[2] In my judgment dated October 25, 2005, I allowed the appellants’ appeals for the 1996 and 1997 taxation years but did not deal with this issue.

[3] I share the position argued by the respondent at the hearing according to which, under paragraph 96(1)(e.1) of the Act, any expenditures made in a taxation year must be deducted in computing partnership income or loss in the taxation year in which these expenditures were made. Consequently, it is my opinion that no amount of SR&ED expenses can be carried over to a subsequent year. Since the only issue in these appeals was the application of paragraph 96(1)(e.1) of the Act, the appellants’ appeals for the 1996 and 1997 taxation years are dismissed and the necessary adjustments will have to be made by the Minister of National Revenue (the “Minister”).

[4] Furthermore, in the appeals numbered 204-2803(IT)I, 2004‑2804(IT)I and 2004-2805(IT)I, concerning appellants Jean-François Blais and Christiane Auray-Blais and Innovations et intégrations brassicoles inc. respectively for the 2001 taxation year, the parties signed an agreement at the hearing[2] concerning the deductibility of certain expenses claimed by the appellants. The highlights of this agreement, which I did not take into account in my judgment of October 25, 2005, could be summarized as follows:

(i) the Minister correctly considered the expenses claimed by the appellants in appeals 2004-2803(IT)I and 2004-2804(IT)I and totalling $1,248 ($2,496 x 50%) as capital expenses;[3]

(ii) the expenses claimed by the appellants in appeals 2004-2803(IT)I and 2004-2804(IT)I and disallowed by the Minister must be reduced to $989 ($1,978 x 50%);[4]

(iii) the Minister incorrectly disallowed expenses totalling $416 claimed by the appellant in appeal 2004-2805(IT)I.[5]

[5] I therefore endorse this agreement.

[6] However, my reasons for judgment dated October 25, 2005, stand.
