B. ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

19) The issue is whether the Appellant’s chief source of income was farming or a combination of farming and some other source of income during the 1997 and 1998 Taxation Years.

C. STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT

20) He relies on sections 3 and 9, subsections 31(1) and 248(1) and paragraphs 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h) of the Act as amended for the 1997 and 1998 Taxation Years.

[2] The Appellant admitted paragraphs 16, 17 a), c), d), f), g), h), i), j), k), l), o), p), q), r), s), t), and 18. Assumptions 17 m), n) u), v) and w) were not refuted. The remaining paragraphs are in dispute.

[3] On the basis of the Section 31 assessment, the Appellant had a reasonable expectation of profit. On the totality of evidence, his time spent was about equal between his employment and farming, but if anything, some more time would have been spent farming. As a result, the question becomes if the Appellant could have made a significant profit in 1997 and 1998, why didn’t he?

[4] The farm owned by the Appellant was originally homesteaded by his grandfather in World War I, farmed by his father and bought by him, one-quarter from his father’s foreclosure proceedings and one-quarter from his father’s estate. His mother’s land, which he leases, was homesteaded by his great-grandfather and kept in the family. The Appellant’s home is on his mother’s land. The Appellant was raised in farming throughout his boyhood and has been involved in farming ever since then. The Appellant owned and lost the additional land through another foreclosure purchase which was subject to an option to purchase by the original foreclosed farmer. That farmer recovered financially and exercised his option to buy from the Appellant in 1996. As a result, the Appellant’s total land farmed was reduced substantially to less than three quarters of a section in 1997 and 1998. This occurrence affected profitability in 1997 and 1998. At about that time, land prices in his area increased by about 20 percent plus to $100,000 per quarter and cash rents had become about $50 per acre. The Appellant feels that he cannot make a profit at those rates if he has to purchase or rent. The Court finds that this is a valid business decision.

[5] The fall of 1996 was unusually wet in the Birch Hills area where the Appellant farmed. As a result, his crop was left in the fields over the winter and harvested in the spring of 1997 respecting the barley crop only. The Appellant chose to leave the barley, his lowest-priced crop, in the fields. That spring, his tractor caught fire and, as a result, was in repair for about six months. He was forced to lease a new John Deere tractor. This unexpected occurrence also affected the Appellant’s costs in 1997 and 1998. As a result of this, the Appellant had two combines and two tractors. In the fall of 1997, he traded one combine and one tractor to acquire a combine. In the fall of 1998, he traded one combine and one tractor for a new tractor, which reduced his financial and his interest payments and spread them over four years. In other words, he tried to rationalize his operation with better equipment at a lower cash output.

[6] At the end of 1998, the Appellant applied for and received Federal Agriculture Income Disaster Assistance grant, which is paid if your 1998 farm income falls below 70 percent of your previous average farm income. He received $383.91 after allowing for his NISA and other AIDA payments, Exhibit A-8. This occurrence indicates to the Court that one arm of the Federal Government considered the Appellant to be a farmer in 1998. It also indicates the Appellant’s historic level of farm income in 1998.

[7] The Appellant’s income figures that are important respecting this case are as follows:

Employment Income

Gross Farm Income

Net Farm Income

CCA Taken

1997

$46,629

$94,575

($12,604)

$19,492.99

1998

$49,495

$72,309

$24,023

$26,617.94

[8] Thus in each year, the Appellant would have a profit from farming had CCA not been taken. Moreover, the Appellant’s expenses in CCA in 1997 would have been less had he not been harvesting in the spring of 1997 and had he not had the tractor fire then. Similarly, his CCA in 1998 would have been less had he not, in a businesslike fashion, done his 1997 and 1998 trades, which were initiated by the tractor fire. Finally, in the Court’s view, taking CCA is optional.

[9] The Court notes two further relevant factors in this case:

(1) the Appellant does not live on the farmland that he owns or rents. He lives on his mother’s land. Thus, his farming is a business operation without a personal asset.

(2) the Appellant made a profit of $18,057 from farming in 2000.

[10] In all of these circumstances, the Court finds that the Appellant’s farming operation was capable of making a significant profit in 1997 and 1998 and would have had there not occurred:

(1) the exercise of the option to purchase in 1996;

(2) the wet fall in 1996 and the spring harvest of 1997; and

(3) the 1997 tractor fire, all of which had carryover effects as to costs in the subsequent years and as to income in the subsequent years, but particularly in 1997 and 1998.

[11] The appeal is allowed. The Appellant is awarded the sum of $300 to reimburse him for out-of-pocket disbursements incurred on account of the prosecution of this appeal and the hearing in Regina.
