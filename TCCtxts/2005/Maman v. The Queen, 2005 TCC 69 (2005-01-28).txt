REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

PARIS J.: It seems clear to me, Mr. Saïman, that I do not have jurisdiction to grant this extension. I agree with counsel for the Respondent concerning the absence of a legal mechanism in the law to extend the time limit of thirty days found in section 304 of the Act: there is no mechanism. Where Parliament wished to provide a mechanism to extend time limits, it did so. That is clear.

So, the absence of a mechanism, in my opinion, reinforces the conclusion that the time limit is compulsory, that there is no way that this Court can extend the time limit. And I am sorry but, as I have already mentioned, I am bound by the Act and I have no jurisdiction in terms of equity, as you asked, and I am obliged to follow the decisions of this Court as well as the clear texts of the Act, and, for these reasons, I must dismiss the application.
