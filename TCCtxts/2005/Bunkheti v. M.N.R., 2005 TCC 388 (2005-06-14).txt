REASONS FOR ORDER

Bédard J.

[1] The application by counsel for the appellant to be removed as counsel of record was heard at Montréal, Quebec, on April 11, 2005.

[2] At the very start of the hearing, counsel for the appellant informed the Court that the appellant was not present, despite the fact that he had informed him of the date and place of the hearing. Furthermore, the appellant had not communicated with his lawyer to inform him that he would be absent from the hearing or even to give him the reason for that absence.

[3] Counsel for the appellant made an application to the Court for an order granting him leave to be removed as counsel of record in the instant case. The reasons he gave in support of his application were his client's lack of cooperation, trust and communication. He also brought it to the Court's attention that he could not manage the case or make any defence without his client's cooperation. He added that his numerous attempts to contact his client, by e-mail, telephone and other means, had been in vain.

[4] For the above reasons, the Court grants the application.

[5] Furthermore, the Court orders that this appeal be set down for hearing on a date to be determined by it.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 14th day of June 2005.
