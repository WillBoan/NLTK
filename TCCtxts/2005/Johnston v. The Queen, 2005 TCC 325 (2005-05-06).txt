2. On January 30, 2004the Appellant served a Notice of Objection on the Respondent.

3. On May 31, 2004 the Respondent issued a Notice of Confirmation in this matter.

4. No Notice of Objection or application for extension of time was received by the Minister within the times set forth in the Income Tax Act (the "Act").

[3] The Appellant testified that he couriered a Notice of Objection to the reassessment, executed on January 30, 2004 and filed February 15, 2004, (Exhibit R-3).

Dear Mr. Johnston:

Re: Notice of objection for the 1998 taxation year.

We have completed our review of your objection for the above-mentioned taxation year.

As a result of our review, we have confirmed the assessment. We have explained the Minister's decision in the attached Notice of Confirmation.

If you disagree with the decision, you can file an appeal with the Tax Court of Canada. We have attached information on how to proceed with an appeal.

Yours sincerely,

[5] On this basis the Appellant filed this Notice of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada on August 27, 2004.

[6] Therefore, Appellant's counsel argues; there is an offer dated May 31, 2004 which the Appellant accepted by filing the Notice of Appeal on August 27, 2004. The Appellant's counsel argued that as a statutory court, the Tax Court of Canada can accept jurisdiction which is conferred on it by the contract of the parties.

[7] Because this argument took Respondent's counsel by surprise, this matter was adjourned to enable her to file a written argument, which she did. Appellant's counsel did not file any further argument.

[8] The first question is whether, in these circumstances, the Minister of National Revenue has the power under the Act to even make such an offer. Sections 165, 166.1 and 169 of the Act read as follows:

165. (1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,

(a) where the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual (other than a trust) or a testamentary trust, on or before the later of

(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer's filing-due date for the year, and

(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of mailing of the notice of assessment; and

(b) in any other case, on or before the day that is 90 days after the day of mailing of the notice of assessment.

(1.1) Notwithstanding subsection 165(1), where at any time the Minister assesses tax, interest, penalties or other amounts payable under this Part by, or makes a determination in respect of, a taxpayer

(a) under subsection 67.5(2) or 152(1.8), subparagraph 152(4)(b)(i) or subsection 152(4.3) or (6), 161.1(7), 164(4.1), 220(3.4) or 245(8) or in accordance with an order of a court vacating, varying or restoring an assessment or referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment,

(b) under subsection 165(3) where the underlying objection relates to an assessment or a determination made under any of the provisions or circumstances referred to in paragraph 165(1.1)(a), or

(c) under a provision of an Act of Parliament requiring an assessment to be made that, but for that provision, would not be made because of subsections 152(4) to 152(5),

the taxpayer may object to the assessment or determination within 90 days after the day of mailing of the notice of assessment or determination, but only to the extent that the reasons for the objection can reasonably be regarded

(d) where the assessment or determination was made under subsection 152(1.8), as relating to any matter or conclusion specified in paragraph 152(1.8)(a), 152(1.8)(b) or 152(1.8)(c), and

(e) in any other case, as relating to any matter that gave rise to the assessment or determination

and that was not conclusively determined by the court, and this subsection shall not be read or construed as limiting the right of the taxpayer to object to an assessment or a determination issued or made before that time.

(1.11) Where a corporation that was a large corporation in a taxation year (within the meaning assigned by subsection 225.1(8)) objects to an assessment under this Part for the year, the notice of objection shall

(a) reasonably describe each issue to be decided;

(b) specify in respect of each issue, the relief sought, expressed as the amount of a change in a balance (within the meaning assigned by subsection 152(4.4)) or a balance of undeducted outlays, expenses or other amounts of the corporation; and

(c) provide facts and reasons relied on by the corporation in respect of each issue.

(1.12) Notwithstanding subsection 165(1.11), where a notice of objection served by a corporation to which that subsection applies does not include the information required by paragraph 165(1.11)(b) or 165(1.11)(c) in respect of an issue to be decided that is described in the notice, the Minister may in writing request the corporation to provide the information, and those paragraphs shall be deemed to be complied with in respect of the issue if, within 60 days after the request is made, the corporation submits the information in writing to a Chief of Appeals referred to in subsection 165(2).

(1.13) Notwithstanding subsections 165(1) and 165(1.1), where under subsection 165(3) a particular assessment was made for a taxation year pursuant to a notice of objection served by a corporation that was a large corporation in the year (within the meaning assigned by subsection 225.1(8)), except where the objection was made to an earlier assessment made under any of the provisions or circumstances referred to in paragraph 165(1.1)(a), the corporation may object to the particular assessment in respect of an issue

(a) only if the corporation complied with subsection 165(1.11) in the notice with respect to that issue; and

(b) only with respect to the relief sought in respect of that issue as specified by the corporation in the notice.

(1.14) Where a particular assessment is made under subsection 165(3) pursuant to an objection made by a taxpayer to an earlier assessment, subsection 165(1.13) does not limit the right of the taxpayer to object to the particular assessment in respect of an issue that was part of the particular assessment and not part of the earlier assessment.

(1.15) Notwithstanding subsection 165(1), where the Minister makes a determination under subsection 152(1.4) in respect of a fiscal period of a partnership, an objection in respect of the determination may be made only by one member of the partnership, and that member must be either

(a) designated for that purpose in the information return made under section 229 of the Income Tax Regulations for the fiscal period; or

(b) otherwise expressly authorized by the partnership to so act.

(1.2) Notwithstanding subsections 165(1) and 165(1.1), no objection may be made by a taxpayer to an assessment made under subsection 118.1(11), 152(4.2), 169(3) or 220(3.1) nor, for greater certainty, in respect of an issue for which the right of objection has been waived in writing by the taxpayer.

(2) A notice of objection under this section shall be served by being addressed to the Chief of Appeals in a District Office or a Taxation Centre of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and delivered or mailed to that Office or Centre.

(2.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, paragraph (1)(a) shall apply only in respect of assessments, determinations and redeterminations under this Part and Part I.2.

(3) On receipt of a notice of objection under this section, the Minister shall, with all due dispatch, reconsider the assessment and vacate, confirm or vary the assessment or reassess, and shall thereupon notify the taxpayer in writing of the Minister's action.

(3.1) (Repealed by S.C. 1998, c. 19, s. 192(4).)

(3.2) (Repealed by S.C. 1998, c. 19, s. 192(4).)

(4) (Repealed by S.C. 1994, c. 7, Sch. VIII, s. 98(3).)

(5) The limitations imposed under subsections 152(4) and 152(4.01) do not apply to a reassessment made under subsection 165(3).

(6) The Minister may accept a notice of objection served under this section that was not served in the manner required by subsection 165(2).

(7) Where a taxpayer has served in accordance with this section a notice of objection to an assessment and thereafter the Minister reassesses the tax, interest, penalties or other amount in respect of which the notice of objection was served or makes an additional assessment in respect thereof and sends to the taxpayer a notice of the reassessment or of the additional assessment, as the case may be, the taxpayer may, without serving a notice of objection to the reassessment or additional assessment,

(a) appeal therefrom to the Tax Court of Canada in accordance with section 169; or

(b) amend any appeal to the Tax Court of Canada that has been instituted with respect to the assessment by joining thereto an appeal in respect of the reassessment or the additional assessment in such manner and on such terms, if any, as the Tax Court of Canada directs.

166.1. (1) Where no notice of objection to an assessment has been served under section 165, nor any request under subsection 245(6) made, within the time limited by those provisions for doing so, the taxpayer may apply to the Minister to extend the time for serving the notice of objection or making the request.

(2) An application made under subsection 166.1(1) shall set out the reasons why the notice of objection or the request was not served or made, as the case may be, within the time otherwise limited by this Act for doing so.

(3) An application under subsection 166.1(1) shall be made by being addressed to the Chief of Appeals in a District Office or a Taxation Centre of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and delivered or mailed to that Office or Centre, accompanied by a copy of the notice of objection or a copy of the request, as the case may be.

(4) The Minister may accept an application under this section that was not made in the manner required by subsection 166.1(3).

(5) On receipt of an application made under subsection 166.1(1), the Minister shall, with all due dispatch, consider the application and grant or refuse it, and shall thereupon notify the taxpayer in writing of the Minister's decision.

(6) Where an application made under subsection 166.1(1) is granted, the notice of objection or the request, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been served or made on the day the decision of the Minister is mailed to the taxpayer.

(7) No application shall be granted under this section unless

(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection or making a request, as the case may be; and

(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that

(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice or making such a request, as the case may be, the taxpayer

(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer's name, or

(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,

(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and

(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted.

169. (1) Where a taxpayer has served notice of objection to an assessment under section 165, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada to have the assessment vacated or varied after either

(a) the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed, or

(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the notice of objection and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer that the Minister has vacated or confirmed the assessment or reassessed,

but no appeal under this section may be instituted after the expiration of 90 days from the day notice has been mailed to the taxpayer under section 165 that the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed.

(1.1) Where at any particular time a taxpayer has disposed of a property, the fair market value of which has been confirmed or redetermined by the Minister of the Environment under subsection 118.1(10.4), the taxpayer may, within 90 days after the day on which that Minister has issued a certificate under subsection 118.1(10.5), appeal the confirmation or redetermination to the Tax Court of Canada.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection 169(1), where at any time the Minister assesses tax, interest, penalties or other amounts payable under this Part by, or makes a determination in respect of, a taxpayer

(a) under subsection 67.5(2) or 152(1.8), subparagraph 152(4)(b)(i) or subsection 152(4.3) or 152(6), 164(4.1), 220(3.4) or 245(8) or in accordance with an order of a court vacating, varying or restoring the assessment or referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment,

(b) under subsection 165(3) where the underlying objection relates to an assessment or a determination made under any of the provisions or circumstances referred to in paragraph 169(2)(a), or

(c) under a provision of an Act of Parliament requiring an assessment to be made that, but for that provision, would not be made because of subsections 152(4) to 152(5),

the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada within the time limit specified in subsection 169(1), but only to the extent that the reasons for the appeal can reasonably be regarded

(d) where the assessment or determination was made under subsection 152(1.8), as relating to any matter specified in paragraph 152(1.8)(a), 152(1.8)(b) or 152(1.8)(c), and

(e) in any other case, as relating to any matter that gave rise to the assessment or determination

and that was not conclusively determined by the Court, and this subsection shall not be read or construed as limiting the right of the taxpayer to appeal from an assessment or a determination issued or made before that time.

(2.1) Notwithstanding subsections 169(1) and 169(2), where a corporation that was a large corporation in a taxation year (within the meaning assigned by subsection 225.1(8)) served a notice of objection to an assessment under this Part for the year, the corporation may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada to have the assessment vacated or varied only with respect to

(a) an issue in respect of which the corporation has complied with subsection 165(1.11) in the notice, or

(b) an issue described in subsection 165(1.14) where the corporation did not, because of subsection 165(7), serve a notice of objection to the assessment that gave rise to the issue

and, in the case of an issue described in paragraph 169(2.1)(a), the corporation may so appeal only with respect to the relief sought in respect of the issue as specified by the corporation in the notice.

(2.2) Notwithstanding subsections 169(1) and 169(2), for greater certainty a taxpayer may not appeal to the Tax Court of Canada to have an assessment under this Part vacated or varied in respect of an issue for which the right of objection or appeal has been waived in writing by the taxpayer.

(3) Notwithstanding section 152, for the purpose of disposing of an appeal made under a provision of this Act, the Minister may at any time, with the consent in writing of the taxpayer, reassess tax, interest, penalties or other amounts payable under this Act by the taxpayer.

(4) Division I applies, with such modifications as the circumstances require, in respect of a reassessment made under subsection 169(3) as though it had been made under section 152.

[9] None of these sections give the Minister the power to do anything beyond that set out therein.

[10] Thus, by statute, the Minster has no power to make an offer or a contract as alleged by the Appellant.

[11] Similarly, the Tax Court of Canada has no power to accept or deal with a Notice of Appeal which is not within the statutory preconditions set out in the Act.

[12] For the foregoing reasons, this purported Notice of Appeal is quashed.
