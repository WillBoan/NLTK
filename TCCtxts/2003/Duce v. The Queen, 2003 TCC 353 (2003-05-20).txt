(gg) The expenses, detailed in Schedule 1 of paragraph 13 above, paid for by the Appellant for airline tickets, gas, rental car, hotel, the Property's telephone, utilities, maintenance and interest were not incurred by the Appellant for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business or property, but were personal or living expenses of the Appellant's Shareholder and Shareholder's family and/or friends.

B. ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

19. The issues are:

(a) whether the Minister properly denied the expenses as detailed in Schedule 1 of paragraph 13 above on the basis that the Property did not constitute a source of income; and

(b) if it did constitute a source of income:

(i) whether the expenses as detailed in Schedule 1 above were incurred by the Appellant for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business or property or whether they were personal and/or living expenses of the Shareholder; and

(ii) whether the expenses were reasonable in the circumstances and

(iii) whether they were capital in nature and not deductible as current expenses.

C. STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT

20. He relies on, among other things, sections 3, 4, 9, 12, 18, 20, 53, 54, 67, 251 subsections 56(2) and 248(1) and paragraphs 18(1)(a), 18(1)(b), 8(1)(h) and 20(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act (the "Act") as amended for the 1996,1997 and 1998 Taxation Years.

21. He submits that the disallowed expenses, as detailed in Schedule 1 of paragraph 13 above, were not incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business or property within the meaning of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act but were personal or living expenses of the Shareholder and his family or friends within the meaning of paragraph 18(1)(h) of the Act.

22. He submits that the Property did not constitute a source of income for the Appellant in the 1996, 1997 and 1998 Taxation Years as its rental was not undertaken in pursuit of profit and was not sufficiently commercial in nature.

23. He submits that the disallowed expenses if found to be incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income, which is not admitted but is denied, are unreasonable in the circumstances within the meaning of Section 67 of the Act.

24. Alternatively, he submits that if the Property is considered to be a capital investment of the Appellant, then the property taxes, interest and maintenance are not deductible as current expenses and are capital in nature.

[3] Mr. Duce appealed assessments for calendar years 1996, 1997 and 1998 that he received a benefit from Audax either as a Shareholder under subsection 15(1) of the Income Tax Act (the "Act") or as an employee under section 6 of the Act of $25,079, $21,596 and $24,271 respectively. The Court accepts Mr.Duce's testimony that, during the years in question, he was not an employee of Audax.

[4] Of the quote, assumptions 18(a) to (n) inclusive, (q), (r), (s), (v), (w), (aa), (bb), (dd) and (ee) were either not refuted or were established by the evidence. Mr. Duce was the sole Shareholder and Director of Audax and of other corporations described in assumption 18(d).

[5] With respect to the remaining Audax assumptions in paragraph 18, the Court finds:

(o) The Appellant has been separated from his wife, Darlene, since about 1984, when the Property was purchased. The couple have two sons who are now adults; they only visited the Property once with Mr. Duce and that was not in 1996, 1997 or 1998.

(p)(t) Audax had the use of the Property for 365 days of the year. The Shareholder did not. After real estate prices in Hawaii collapsed in 1992, Audax, because it had been losing money renting, decided to use the Property for promotional purposes for Audax's and its related corporations' businesses and it did so. Based upon the actual use by Mr. Duce in the years in question, as compared to other users, the Court finds that Audax did use the Property for promotional purposes and did so successfully.

(u) The Court finds that annual visits to the Property by someone on Audax's behalf were necessary for the purposes of maintenance, upkeep and, generally, good management. Mr. Duce was that person. Mr. Duce admitted that his visits were for a "rest" and were 50% personal although he testified that the first 4 to 6 hours of each day in Hawaii were usually spent on business. Nonetheless, his visits to Hawaii were intended to get him away from a very busy little oil business operated by his various companies in the Estevan area of Saskatchewan, and they did so.

(x) Audax had a business plan for the Property from the beginning; it changed slightly, as will be shown. The Property was purchased to "flip" when its value reached $500,000 U.S. Audax thought it could rent the Property and pay the mortgage down at a profit. It could not. Just before the price collapse in 1992, comparable properties were selling for over $300,000 U.S. and asking prices were in the $400,000 U.S. range. After the collapse, combined with a bad tenant experience and followed by a damaging water leak, Audax decided to stop losing money by renting and to use the Property for promotional free stays until the price of $500,000 U.S. was again achieved. There is no evidence that this selling agenda was even abandoned, but in the interim, the use had changed.

(y) Thus the Property was used by Audax for promotion in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The Court finds that this was successful and proved profitable to Audax both respecting customer and employee usage. The property was a source of income to Audax and its related corporations through tips, discounts and deals it brought about, one way or another.

(z) There is a reasonable expectation that the Property can be sold at a profit as was intended when it was purchased. The 1999 Honolulu property tax assessment of the property fixes its value at $148,900 U.S. (Exhibit A-2).

(cc) The property is not a personal use property for the use in enjoyment of Mr. Duce and his friends and family.

(ff) Is correct as a matter of law, however, on the evidence, the Property is not a capital investment. It is an income item, purchased with the intention to "flip" it at a profit.

[6] Assumption 18(gg) goes to the heart of the appeal, and will be dealt with as follows:

1. Travel Expenses

The Court finds that Mr. Duce's primary purpose in travelling to Hawaii in 1996, 1997 and 1998 was for a rest. The travel expenses he incurred were personal or living expenses to him and were properly disallowed pursuant to subsection 15(1) of the Act.

2. Property Expenses

The Property was acquired for a business purpose, namely to sell at a profit. In the years in question it was used for a business purpose, namely to promote the business of Audax and its related and associated corporations. These two purposes were, jointly, the primary purposes that Audax owned the Property in 1996, 1997 and 1998. On that basis, the determination of any personal benefit to Mr. Duce is based upon the actual usage of the Property. (McHugh v. Her Majesty the Queen, [1995] 1 C.T.C. 2652.) The Court calculates the usage as follows:

(i) Overall Seasonal Days of Usage Based Upon First and Last Occupancy Dates in Evidence

1997

1998

1999

Mr. Duce

14

17

29

Total of all users

117

175

227

(ii) Actual Number of Days Used in Each Year

1997

1998

1999

Mr. Duce

17

19

25

All users

87 +or -

82-5

130

Because actual usage is the McHugh criterion, the Court adopts number (ii) as described. For the three years, Mr. Duce's usage averaged approximately 20% of the total usage of the Property.

[7] Therefore, these matters are referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that all of the travel expenses in question were of personal benefit to Mr. Duce pursuant to subsection 15(1) of the Act; and that 20% of the Property expenses in question were a personal benefit to Mr. Duce pursuant to subsection 15(1) of the Act.
