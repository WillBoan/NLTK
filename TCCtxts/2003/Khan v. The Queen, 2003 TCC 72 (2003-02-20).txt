AHSAN M. KHAN,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Little, J.

A. FACTS

[1] The Appellant, the Appellant's spouse (Rafat Khan) and the Appellant's daughter (Mehre Yousuff Khan) (the spouse and the daughter are hereinafter referred to as the "Joint Owners") were the registered owners of a house located at 10271 Odlin Road, Richmond, British Columbia (the "Property").

[2] In March 1995 the Appellant and the Joint Owners borrowed $369,166.00 from Bawa Singh Bains and Gurmej Kaur Bains. To secure the loan a mortgage was registered against the Property.

[3] During the 1998 and 1999 taxation years the Property was the principal residence of the Appellant and the Joint Owners.

[4] The Appellant claimed that he suffered rental losses in connection with the Property. The Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") denied the rental losses.

[5] In the Reply counsel for the Respondent alleged that during the 1998 and 1999 taxation years no portion of the Property was rented to tenants.

B. ISSUES

[6](a) Did the Appellant rent any portion of the Property to tenants in the 1998 and 1999 taxation years?

(b) Did the Appellant incur any expenses in connection with the Property?

(c) Is the Appellant entitled to deduct all or a portion of the rental losses that were claimed in determining his income for the 1998 and 1999 taxation years?

C. ANALYSIS

[7] It is clear from the evidence that was presented to the Court that the Appellant did rent a portion of the Property to tenants in the 1998 taxation year and for the months of January to April in the 1999 taxation year. The Appellant presented evidence which established that the following rental payments had been received:

1998

1999

$8,400.00

$2,100.00

(See Exhibit A-6.)

[8] During the hearing of the appeal the Appellant maintained that he paid interest on the mortgage of $18,404.00 in 1998 and $18,102.24 in 1999.

[9] Based on the evidence that was presented to the Court, I have concluded that the interest expense in 1998 and 1999 should be determined as follows:

1998 - $18,404.00 รท 2 = $9,202.00

(Note - one-half of the interest expense is business and one-half is personal.)

1999 - $18,102.24 รท 2 = $9,051.12

(Note - I have concluded that interest should only be recognized for the months of January, February, March and April 1999.)

$9,051.00 รท 3 = $3,017.00

[10] The interest expense of $18,404.00 for 1998 should be allocated as follows:

The Appellant

$3,067.33

Rafat Khan

$3,067.33

Mehre Yousuff Khan

$3,067.33

[11] The interest expense of $3,017.00 in 1999 should be allocated as follows:

The Appellant

$1,005.66

Rafat Khan

$1,005.66

Mehre Yousuff Khan

$1,005.66

[12] Based on the evidence that was presented to the Court (Exhibit A-9) the Appellant and the Joint Owners should include the following rent in their income:

1998

1999

The Appellant

$2,800.00

$700.00

Rafat Khan

$2,800.00

$700.00

Mehre Yousuff Khan

$2,800.00

$700.00

[13] The evidence that was presented to the Court did not convince me that the Appellant paid property taxes, utilities and water and sewage expenses in the 1998 and 1999 years. (Note: In a Petition to the Supreme Court of British Columbia filed by Bawa Singh Bains and Gurmej Kaur Bains dated May 6, 1999 (Exhibit A-3) it is stated that the Appellant and the Joint Owners failed to pay to the City of Richmond all property taxes for the 1997 and 1998 years.)

[14] The appeal is allowed to permit the Appellant to claim interest expenses as follows:

1998

1999

$3,067.33

$1,005.66

[15] The Appellant would also be required to include the following rent in his income:

1998

1999

$2,800.00

$700.00

[16] I am not prepared to accept the authorizations of the Appellant's spouse and the Appellant's daughter authorizing the Court to allocate all of the rental losses from the Property to the Appellant. However, to be fair and consistent the Minister should reassess the Appellant's spouse and the Appellant's daughter on the following basis:

Spouse

1998

1999

Rental Income

$2,800.00

$700.00

Interest Deduction

$3,067.33

$1,005.66

Daughter

1998

1999

Rental Income

$2,800.00

$700.00

Interest Deduction

$3,067.33

$1,005.66

[17] The appeals from the assessments made under the Income Tax Act for the 1998 and 1999 taxation years are allowed, without costs, and the assessments are referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment.
