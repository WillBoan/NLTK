ORDER AND REASONS FOR ORDER

WHEREAS UPON the return of the Respondent's motion for an order to strike out certain portions of the Notice of Appeal, the Appellant sought an Order;

1. Staying all steps in this appeal; or

2. Requiring the Respondent to file and serve a Notice of Reply to the Notice of Appeal by June 20, 2003;

AND WHEREAS the written and oral submissions presented to the Court during the hearing described the proceedings between the parties in the Federal Court of Canada - Trial Division and the Federal Court of Appeal;

AND WHEREAS it appears to be just, expeditious and least expensive to defer the hearing of the Respondent's motion until the matters before the Federal Court of Appeal have been dealt with in order that the Tax Court of Canada may have the benefit of the guidance of the Federal Court of Appeal;

THIS COURT ORDERS:

1. The Respondent's motion to strike certain portions of the Notice of Appeal is adjourned until the matters in the Federal Court of Appeal in Court file numbers A-179-02 and A-180-02 have been dealt with.

2. The time to serve and file a Reply to the Notice of Appeal is extended to a date 60 days after the disposition of the Respondent's motion to strike certain portions of the Notice of Appeal.

Signed at Toronto, Ontario, this 4th day of July 2003.

"J. M. Woods"
