HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Sheridan, J.

ISSUE

[1] The issue is whether $10,000 received by the Appellant in the 2000 taxation year was her property as the surviving joint GIC account holder or was income paid to her in the form of executor's fees.

FACTS

[7] Ms. Oolup is a credible witness. Her explanation of events is reasonable in the unique circumstances of this case and the reality of the family dynamic. Although she accepted her lawyer's opinion that the GIC funds belonged to her as the surviving joint account holder, she "didn't feel comfortable" with the idea of keeping all the money for herself. She knew her grandmother wanted her to have the GIC's because of all the time they had spent together. She found repugnant, however, the prospect of her relatives concluding that the money had been her motivation behind her devotion to her grandparents. To avoid this outcome, she chose to share all but $10,000 of "her" GIC money with her family.

[8] In answer to the Minister's assertions regarding the impact of the documentary evidence, Ms. Oolup argues that bare description of the $10,000 as "executrix fees"in what is clearly a standard form Distribution & Release letter is not determinative of the issue. Her evidence is that this document had been prepared "out of habit" and, in the words of her lawyer " ... for the sake of convenience". Given the modest amounts involved and the unique quality of Ms. Oolup's generous impulses, Mr. Shea's resort to the use of more-or-less applicable standard form documents provided a practical, if somewhat imprecise, record of the transaction. On the evidence presented, Ms. Oolup's decision to share the GIC money equally among her grandmother's four children is as consistent with wanting to keep peace in the family as it is with giving effect to the terms of the will.

[9] The Court is satisfied that on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant has successfully rebutted the presumption of resulting trust and that the GIC funds became her property following her grandmother's death. Accordingly, the $10,000 retained by the Appellant as the surviving joint account holder was not received as executor's fees and ought not to be included as income under s. 5(1).

[10] The appeal is allowed.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 30th day of December 2003.
