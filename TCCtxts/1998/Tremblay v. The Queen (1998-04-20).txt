LINDA TREMBLAY,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Guy Tremblay, J.T.C.C.

Issue

[1] According to the Notice of Appeal and the Reply to the Notice of Appeal, at issue is whether the appellant is justified in claiming the child tax benefit for Caroline et Karine, her twin daughters born in May 1979, for the months from October 1994 to March 1995.

[2] Initially, the respondent apparently granted the appellant $518.75 for the period from July 1994 to June 1995. Subsequently, that decision was changed and the respondent is now claiming $1,037.52 from the appellant. It would appear that the appellant's former spouse had custody of the twin girls from October 1994 to March 1995.

Burden of proof

[3] The burden of proof is on the appellant, who must establish that the assessment made by the respondent is unfounded. This burden of proof is based on a number of court decisions, including the judgment by the Supreme Court of Canada in Johnston v. Minister of National Revenue.[1]

[4] In that judgment, the Supreme Court ruled that the facts assumed by the respondent in support of the assessments or reassessments are presumed to be true until proven otherwise. In the present case, the facts assumed by the respondent are set out in subparagraphs 5(a) to (d) of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal. Paragraph 5 reads as follows:

[translation]

5. In drawing up the November 20, 1996 notice of child tax benefit for the 1993 base year, the Minister assumed in particular the following facts:

(a) during the 1993 taxation year, the appellant was separated from Rémi Desgagné, her former spouse; [admitted]

(b) On March 3, 1995, Rémi Desgagné applied for the child tax benefit for Caroline and Karine, his twin daughters, of whom he had had custody and for whom he had been responsible since October 1994; [admitted with explanations]

(c) after reviewing the information obtained from the appellant's former spouse, the Minister revised the appellant's child tax benefit to zero for the months from October 1994 to June 1995; [admitted]

(d) the appellant therefore received an overpayment of $1,037.52 for the months from October 1994 to March 1995; [admitted]

Evidence adduced

[5] The appellant admitted the above-quoted subparagraph 5(b). She explained that the civil trial for custody of the children had begun on September 2, 1994 and ended in March 1995 following four postponements and an out-of-court settlement signed on January 5, 1994.

[6] However, a court order had transferred custody of the twin girls to the appellant's former spouse starting on September 2, 1994. The appellant's former spouse retained custody of the twins.

[7] The appellant complains that she never received support payments from her former spouse, and according to the garnishment dated September 22, 1993, the support arrears amounted to $45,850.

[8] Following an agreement signed by the parties on April 18, 1995, the Quebec Superior Court, District of Alma, delivered on May 3, 1995 its judgment in case No 160-12-001106-837. The documents in question read as follows:

RÉMI DESGAGNÉ, domiciled and resident at

527B St-Wilbrod, Hébertville-Station, District of

Alma G0W 1T0,



Applicant;

-v.-

LINDA TREMBLAY, domiciled and resident at

192 du Pont sud, Alma, District of Alma,

Respondent.

JUDGMENT

This is an application to change child custody and to cancel support payments.

At the time of the application, an agreement concerning support, duly signed by the parties, was filed and it was requested that a judgment be issued ratifying the said agreement.

Concerning custody of the minor children, Caroline and Karine, a psychosocial assessment report prepared on March 2, 1995 by Mr. Réal Maltais, a social worker, was filed before the court. That report recommends that custody of the children be given to their father and that access rights be granted to the mother. The mother agrees with this recommendation, but objects to the applicant's request that custody of the children be made retroactive to September 2, 1994.

Given the evidence adduced, the Court considers it appropriate to act on the psychosocial assessment report, without however making the judgment regarding custody of the children retroactive. The Court considers it appropriate to emphasize to the applicant that custody of his children may be taken from him should he fail to fulfil his obligations in that regard in an appropriate manner.

FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT:

ALLOWS the application in part;

OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGES, RATIFIES and MAKES BINDING the parties' agreement of April 18, 1995, which is to have effect as if each of its clauses were set out in full herein, and ORDERS the parties to abide by that agreement;

GIVES custody of the minor children, Caroline and Karine, to the applicant;

GRANTS the respondent rights of access to her two children in accordance with the wishes expressed by the said children;

THE WHOLE with each party to bear his or her own costs.

SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE

Me ALAIN BERGERON

Counsel for the applicant

MORENCY DUCHESNE (Me Micheline Paradis)

Counsel for the respondent

[9] Since the Superior Court judgment was law between the parties, the respondent must respect its ruling that the father's custody of the children was not retroactive.

Conclusion

[10] The appeal is allowed, with costs, and the assessment is referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment.
