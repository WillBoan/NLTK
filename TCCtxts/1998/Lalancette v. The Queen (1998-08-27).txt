Docket: 96-4388-IT-G

BETWEEN:

JEAN-EUDES LALANCETTE,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

Reasons for Judgment

G. Tremblay, J.T.C.C.

Issue

[1] According to the Notice of Appeal and the Reply to the Notice of Appeal, the issue is whether the appellant was a director of 133139 Canada Limitée from 1990 to 1994 and therefore liable for the debt of $131,435.35 under subsection 227.1(1) of the Income Tax Act (the Act).

[2] The appellant argued that he was never a director of that corporation, even though, as an employee, he played an important role in its operations.

[3] The respondent argued that the appellant was a de facto director.

Burden of proof

[4] The appellant bears the burden of showing that the respondent’s assessments are unfounded. This burden of proof derives from a number of judicial decisions, including that of the Supreme Court of Canada in Johnston v. Minister of National Revenue.[1]

[5] In Johnston, the Supreme Court held that the facts assumed by the respondent in support of assessments or reassessments are presumed to be true until proven otherwise. In the case at bar, the facts assumed by the respondent are set out in subparagraphs (a) to (h) of paragraph 6 of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal, which paragraph reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION]

6. In assessing the appellant under section 227.1(1) of the Income Tax Act, the Minister of National Revenue assumed, inter alia, the following facts:

(a) Jean-Eudes Lalancette was a director and the sole shareholder of the J.E. Lalancette Inc. construction company, which went bankrupt. [denied]

(b) 133139 Canada Ltée was incorporated on June 4, 1984 and is in the residential construction business. [It is a shelf company acquired in 1990.]

(c) The 1990 annual report lists Stéphane Lalancette, Jean-Eudes Lalancette’s 18-year-old son, as the only director of the new company, 133139 Canada Ltée. [admitted]

(d) Jean-Eudes Lalancette makes all decisions concerning the corporation, since it is he who has the necessary expertise. [denied]

(e) Jean-Eudes Lalancette co-signed the corporation’s cheques and signed a number of legal documents as president of the corporation. [admitted, but had authorization]

(f) All of the company’s assets were owned by Jean-Eudes Lalancette, who put them all at the company’s disposal free of charge. [admitted: form panels, small tools]

(g) Jean-Eudes Lalancette signed all relevant documents, such as bids, issued receipts on the company’s behalf, signed declarations of lien and was listed as the company’s principal shareholder, chief executive officer and president, without his son Stéphane appearing as a second signatory. [denied, he had authorization]

(h) A writ of fieri facias was issued on November 15, 1994, and a nulla bona return was issued on January 5, 1995. [admitted, the private dwelling is owned by his spouse]

Facts in evidence

[6] The appellant argued that 133139 Canada Limitée was owned by his son Stéphane and that he himself was merely an employee. The corporation carried on a construction business. Because of his experience, however, and after having a heart attack, the appellant was appointed by his son Stéphane to handle the paperwork: making bids, signing contracts. His salary was that established by the decree for the construction industry. His son worked on the building sites.

[7] The mandate conferred on the appellant by his son on September 9, 1990, reads as follows (Exhibit I-1, Tab 62):

[TRANSLATION]

I, Stéphane Lalancette, president of 133139 Canada Ltée, authorize Jean-Eudes Lalancette to sign bids and contracts for the above-mentioned company, and I have signed.

Stéphane Lalancette, President

[8] The witness maintained that the company was unable to remit source deductions because of losses resulting from the fact that money was not received for work done. His son tried everything to avoid bankruptcy, but he had to face facts.

[9] His son also had to declare personal bankruptcy.

[10] During cross-examination, the respondent filed as Exhibit I-1 a book containing 73 documents.

[11] Tabs 24 and 25 relate to the computation of the $131,435.35 debt, including capital, penalties and interest. The quantum is not in dispute.

[12] Counsel for the respondent drew the appellant's attention to the way in which he was designated or to his signature in the following documents from Exhibit I-1:

DECLARATION

133139 CANADA LTÉE

133139 CANADA LTÉE was incorporated in the province of Quebec by certificates of incorporation issued on June 4, 1984, under the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA).

Its principal place of business is at 358 Tadoussac Blvd., Chicoutimi, Quebec G7H 5A8.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this declaration quadruplicate is made and signed by me, STÉPHANE LALANCETTE, president of the said corporation, at Chicoutimi this 2nd day of August 1990.

AND I HAVE SIGNED

/s/ Stéphane Lalancette

STÉPHANE LALANCETTE

[13] At Tab 58, there is a copy of the register of directors of 133139 Canada Limitée dated July 27, 1990. Stéphane Lalancette is the only person named as a director.

[14] On July 22, 1992, the appellant assigned all of his shares to the company (Tab 56, Exhibit I-1).

[15] On October 13, 1992, according to the minutes (Tab 48, Exhibit I-1), the appellant was considered to be the company’s president. As well, on August 28, 1992 (Tab 53, Exhibit I-1), he signed an affidavit on behalf of 133139 Canada Ltée as chief executive officer.

11. La compagnie au Québec, Volume I, Les aspects juridiques, Éditions Wilson & Lafleur, Martel Ltée, April 1998, source deductions, pp. 574-574.7.

[17] The main cases and the other authorities can be summarized as follows:

Case law

Adey v. Minister of National Revenue ([16]: 1)

The appellant argued that he was merely a silent partner and did not participate in the company’s activities.

He did not know that he was a director. His signature was not in the minute book, but he was the secretary-treasurer of the company and he had the power to bind it by his signature. He was kept informed of the company’s situation and he even tried to raise money to repay its debts.

The Court dismissed the appeal and held that the appellant was a director in fact and in law because of his activities on behalf of the company. [Emphasis added.]

Deschênes v. Minister of National Revenue ([16]: 2)

The appellant argued that he did not manage the day-to-day operation of the business and did not participate in the business and that his diligence had to be judged as that of an investor.

The appellant owned 50 percent of the company. He was a notary practising commercial law. He was the company’s legal adviser.

In his testimony, the appellant said that he had chosen not to pay source deductions. That calculated risk was contrary to what should be done by a diligent director to prevent the failure contemplated by subsection 227.1(1) of the Act.

Hébert v. Le sous-ministre du Revenu du Québec ([16]: 3)

The Lalonde 85 company made an assignment in bankruptcy without remitting the amounts it had collected under the Fuel Tax Act.

The evidence showed that the applicant was always involved in the important actions taken within the company, such as purchasing the business, financing that purchase, selecting shareholders and managing the business.

The appellant therefore had to be considered a de facto director and to assume the responsibilities imposed on him by law. [Emphasis added.]

Myers, J.D. and Wasserfall, William v. The Queen ([16]: 6)

Adelaide Electric Limited failed to remit source deductions from the wages paid to its employees. A receiving order was later made against it.

The appellant [William Wasserfall held all of the company’s shares. The appellant Myers] argued that he was not a director. He argued that he was an employee of Adelaide Electric Limited. The appellant Myers knew that the company was indebted to Revenue Canada, but he recognized the importance of maintaining Mr. Wasserfall in place as director/president. He sought legal advice and was careful not to hold himself out as a director. When an incorrect notice was filed showing himself as a director, the appellant Myers had it rectified.

The appellant Myers was therefore not a de facto or de jure director and his appeal was allowed. Mr. Wasserfall’s appeal was dismissed. [Emphasis added.]

Other authorities

Revenue Canada, Information Circular No. 89-2R, June 27, 1997 ([16]: 10)

De Facto Directors

10. Officers, employees, and others who are not legally appointed as directors, but who perform the functions that directors would perform, may be liable.

La compagnie au Québec, Volume I, Les aspects juridiques

([16]: 11)

p. 574.4

[TRANSLATION]

The status of director is assessed on the basis of the law and also on the basis of the facts. What is important is that the director actually hold or appear to hold that position, even if he has not given any written consent or signed any resolutions. It is not enough to assert that the minutes do not prove he is a director; it must rather be shown that they prove he is not. [Emphasis added.]

Analysis

[18] In this case, the appellant was not listed as a director in the 1990 annual report ([5]: 6(c)) or the declaration made to the prothonotary on August 2, 1990 ([12]: Tab 61).

[19] However, based on a review of the above evidence in the light of the case law and other authorities, the appellant must be considered a de facto director, whether or not he is a shareholder or de jure director. The fundamental principle is that the appellant holds himself out to third parties as the company’s chief executive officer, principal shareholder and president. Having done so he cannot then cast aside his responsibilities towards third parties. This is an application of estoppel in commercial matters. The Minister of National Revenue, who is responsible for administering the Income Tax Act, is a third party.

Conclusion

[20] The appeal is dismissed.

Signed at Québec, Quebec, this 27th day of August 1998.
