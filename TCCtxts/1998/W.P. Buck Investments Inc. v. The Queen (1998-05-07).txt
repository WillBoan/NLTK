[3] The parties have agreed that the issue is whether the Appellant seized or repossessed the property prior to March 28, 1991 within the meaning of subsection 183(7) of the Excise Tax Act.

[4] The relevant provisions of the Act[1]read:

183(1) Where at any time after 1990 property of a person is, for the purpose of satisfying in whole or in part a debt or obligation owing by the person to another person (in this section referred to as the "creditor"), seized or repossessed by the creditor under a right or power exercisable by the creditor (other than a right or power that the creditor has under, or because of being a party to, a lease, licence or similar arrangement by which the person acquired the property),

(a) the person shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Part, to have made, at that time, a supply of the property for no consideration; and

(b) the creditor shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Part, to have acquired the property at that time for no consideration.

183(7) For the purposes of this Part, where a creditor who has seized or repossessed property from a person in circumstances in which subsection (1) applies makes at any time a particular taxable supply of the property by way of sale (other than a supply deemed, under any provision of this part other than section 177, to have been made), the creditor was not deemed under subsection (4), (5), (6) or (8) to have made or received a supply of the property at an earlier time and the creditor provides evidence satisfactory to the Minister that the person has not received and is not entitled to claim an input tax credit or a rebate in respect of the property, the creditor shall be deemed

(a) to have received a supply of the property immediately before that time for consideration equal to the consideration for the particular supply; and

(b) to have paid, immediately before that time, tax in respect of the supply deemed under paragraph (a) to have been received equal to the amount determined by the formula

A - B

where

A is tax calculated on that consideration, and

B is the total of all amounts each of which is an input tax credit or a rebate under this Part that the creditor was entitled to claim in respect of the property or an improvement thereto.

Although subsection 183(1) of the Act speaks of seizure and repossession, the parties are agreed there was no seizure in the circumstances of this appeal.

Appellant’s Position

[5] The Appellant’s argument is based solely on the proposition that there was not in fact a repossession during the “limited window period”, i.e. March 1 through March 28, 1991. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the relevant points in time are September 30, 1990 when Desbil defaulted on the mortgage payments; November 29, 1990, the date on which the Appellant executed a notice of attornment of rents directed to the tenant requiring it to pay all of the rents to the Appellant (Exhibit A-1, Tab 2); December 5, 1990, the date of a notice of sale under the Mortgages Act which provided that the property would be sold unless the amount due under the mortgage was paid on or before January 16, 1991 (Exhibit A-1, Tab 4); and December 13, 1990, the date on which a direction made at the joint request of both the mortgagor and the mortgagee that payments be made to A. Farber Associates, in trust. Thus, the Appellant contends that January 16, 1991 was the date at which the repossession was effectively chrystallized since the expiry of the notice under the power of sale vested the Appellant with authority to deal with the property.

[6] Counsel further submitted that the date of the sale of the property, October 15, 1991, is not relevant since it is not necessary for the property to be actually sold to finally deprive the mortgagor of any rights to redeem the property. He argued that

... when we say that it is necessary for the mortgagee to have demonstrated or taken steps to exercise control and to be in a position to transfer rights in the property, just being in the position of being able to transfer rights should be sufficient.

It should not be necessary then to require the next logical -- or the final logical step in that process, namely, the actual sale of property, for both the legal reasons as to the wording on subsection 183(7), and because there is a big difference between vested with the ability to transfer rights and actually transferring those rights.

Thus, it was argued, commencing with the notice of attornment, the Appellant acted upon its intention to assume control over the property, which was followed by the expiry of the notice period under the power of sale on January 16, 1991, during the “window period”. It is the Appellant’s position that on this date, it was vested with the ability to transfer title to the property to a third person. All of the subsequent steps to ultimately consummate the sale, which took place outside of the “window period” are not relevant to the primary issue in this appeal.

Respondent’s position

[7] Counsel for the Respondent relied on the well established proposition that “a mortgagee takes possession when he deprives the mortgagor of the control and management of the mortgaged property”.[2] This, the Respondent contends, did not take place until, at the very earliest, January 1, 1992 from which date onward it was agreed that the rental income generated from the property would be collected directly by the Appellant (Exhibit A-1, Tab 13), or on February 27, 1992, the closing date of the sale of the property by the Appellant. Neither of these periods fall within the time frame stipulated by the relevant provisions of the Act.

[8] Counsel for the Respondent argues that what a mortgagee must do to take possession in circumstances such as those before this Court has been well established in law. Reference was made to the following comments in Noyes v. Pollock:[3]

In order to hold that a mortgagee not in actual possession is in receipt of the rents and profits, in my opinion, it ought to be shown, not only that he gets the amount of the rents paid by the tenants, even although he gets their cheques or their cash, but that he receives it in such a way that it can be properly said that he has taken upon himself to intercept the power of the mortgagor to manage his estate, and has himself so managed and received the rents as part of the management of the estate.

... But in the case where an estate is let to tenants, of course the mortgagee does not enter upon actual occupation of the demised premises. He may fall under the principle as a person who enters and takes possession of the rents and profits; but only, as it seems to me, if he does something which goes beyond the mere receipt of sums of money to which the rents and profits may amount, and reaches a point at which he displaces, for the purpose of realizing the security, the mortgagor from the control and dominion of the reversion of the estate which is demised. Unless the dominion and control is taken in that sense, the mere receipt of the produce of the management may be taken by the mortgagee, and yet he may stop short of taking the management itself. ...

[9] The Respondent also takes the position that the rights of a mortgagor do not expire or terminate with the issue by the mortgagee of a notice of sale under mortgage. Such a notice of sale serves as nothing more than a limitation on the rights of the mortgagee.[4]

Conclusion

[10] As was observed by Counsel for the Respondent, the test of whether a mortgagee has obtained possession, actual or constructive, of the mortgaged premises is a question of fact and turns on whether the mortgagee has acted to take such steps as are necessary to deprive the mortgagor of the control and management of the property. Since a mortgagee is not compelled by law to take possession upon default, and because possession entails obligations on the part of the mortgagee vis à vis the mortgagor,[5] the steps taken must evidence an intent to take possession. No such evidence exists in the present case.

[11] It is important to note that as of the end of March, the only steps that had been taken by the Appellant were to issue a notice of sale under the terms of the mortgage; to issue a notice to the tenant of the property as to the attornment of rents, which notice was not acted upon, and to seek a marketing proposal from a realtor regarding the sale of the property.

[12] The position advanced by the Respondent is correct in law. As was observed in 165852 Canada Inc.:[6]

In the Modern Realty judgment, I note the provision that “he must assume the management”. Surely, this puts a positive obligation on the plaintiff in respect of the management of the property after default.

The evidence before me clearly indicates this Appellant neither entered into possession nor took upon itself in any manner to intercept the power of the mortgagor to manage its estate. An intention to deprive the mortgagor of the ability to redeem the property without taking any steps to put that intention into effect is not sufficient. As was observed by Wilson J.A. in Municipal Savings & Loan Corp. v. Wilson:[7]

It is the service on the mortgagor of the notice of the mortgagee’s intention to sell the property that triggers the mortgagor’s equitable right to redeem. The mortgage is security only: the mortgagee’s principle right is to its money ... : Lord Nottingham in Thornborough v. Baker (1675), 3 Swans. 628 at p. 630, 636 E.R. 1000 - if the mortgagee elects to resort to its security, then equity steps in to protect the mortgagor and, if he is able to pay the money, permits him to do so and get his land back.

[13] With respect to the Appellant’s contention that the mortgagor’s rights expired or terminated with the issue by it of a notice of sale, I make reference to the decision in Re Artibello et al. and Standard Trust Co.[8]In that case, Steele J. made the following comment:

It was argued that the notice of power of sale with a date set out therein was a window within which the rights of the mortgagee were waived and that if the mortgagor did not take advantage of this within the time period, he was barred from so doing afterwards. I reject this argument. Once the mortgagee has waived his rights by giving the notice of power of sale then the mortgagor has the right to make the payments and reinstate the mortgage, or pay it in full as in this case and failing that, the mortgagee may proceed to sell. The mortgagor’s rights continue up until the time that a sale is actually made. The mortgagee, once having given notice, cannot maintain an option whether to accept the payment or continue with the sale. The time period that is set out in the notice given under the power of sale is to comply with the provisions of the mortgage and of the Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 296, prohibiting a sale prior to that time. It has nothing to do with fixing a time-limit within which the mortgagor has rights which cease after that time. ...

[14] I am satisfied that if a mortgagee does not take possession, the rights of the mortgagor in and to the property continue until such time as a third party acquires those rights. This would occur upon sale or, perhaps, upon the execution of an agreement of purchase and sale which is subject to specific performance. This did not occur in the present appeal.

[15] The appeal is dismissed, costs to the Respondent, to be taxed.
