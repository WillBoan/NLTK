109. On December 17, 2007, judgment rendered for the Quebec Court of Appeal by the Honourable André Rochon, J.C.A., allowing the appeal, setting aside the judgment of the Superior Court dated August 30, 2005, rendered by the Honourable Martin Bédard, J.S.C., and dismissing the amended motion in appeal of the rejection by the trustee of an amended proof of claim (res judicata for the $304,744.79);[26]

The meeting is scheduled to continue on June 20, 2013, at 10:00 a.m.

119. The appeal involving the rejection of the proof of claim of Canadevim Ltée in the bankruptcy of Mr. LaCasse has yet to be heard as of today. The contestations of the fees and disbursements of the trustees and their counsel in the bankruptcies of Mr. LaCasse and Canadevim Ltée have not been heard.

Facts relating to business investment loss claim

120. As appears from the statement of receipts and disbursements of the former trustee,[27] more than $404,844.58 was collected by the trustee in bankruptcy of Canadevim Ltée through the recovery of the security deposit, the out-of-court settlement, the recovery of inputs, interest earned on deposits, the sale of machinery, etc.;

121. Since the beginning of the contestation of the petition in bankruptcy, Mr. Lacroix’s intention has remained constant, namely, to receive payment for the $1,200,000.00 in work performed on the golf course, in order to cover the debts of Canadevim Ltée;

122. Once that amount was recovered, either in kind or through the taking in payment of the golf course, a motion to annul the forced bankruptcy of Canadevim Ltée would have been filed;

123. In the event that compensation in kind became impossible through the successive sale of the lots subject to the legal hypothec, Mr. Lacroix’s intention was to have Canadevim Ltée bring an action in damages against Revenu Québec and/or trustee in bankruptcy Verdier;

124. It was not until the Supreme Court of Canada denied leave to appeal from the judgment rendered by the Honourable Justice Marc Noël of the Federal Court of Appeal that these possibilities ceased to exist.

[3] Only Yoland Lacasse testified at the hearing. From his testimony, I essentially gather that Canadevim Ltée has not carried on business since its bankruptcy in 2003.

Appellant’s position

[4] In the Notices of Appeal, the appellant essentially claimed that the fees he had incurred were allowable expenses because they were incurred in connection with normal contracts incidental and necessary to the earning of income from a business. I note that, in his Notices of Appeal, the appellant cites sections 2 and 5 of Interpretation Bulletin IT‑99R5 (Consolidated) in support of his position.

[5] In oral argument, the appellant radically changed his position and now submits that the fees were incurred, not for the purpose of earning income from a business, but rather for the purpose of earning income from property. In this respect, the appellant submitted that the fees claimed were incurred in order to recover a $1.2 million claim, with the ultimate purpose of receiving dividends from Canadevim Ltée, namely, income from property. The appellant submitted that, at the time he had incurred the fees, the $1.2 million claim was recoverable, which could have resulted in a retroactive annulment of the bankruptcy of Canadevim Ltée. I note from the outset that the appellant has not explained how the fees (incurred in the course of an appeal from a GST/HST assessment made in respect of Canadevim Ltée for the period from March 1, 1998, to October 31, 2001) were incurred for the purpose of earning income from property.

[6] In the alternative, the appellant is claiming the fees as a business investment loss under paragraph 39(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act (the Act). Essentially, the appellant argues that, on December 7, 2006, the Superior Court of Quebec, relying on section 38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the BIA), authorized him to continue his challenge in the appeal of a GST/HST assessment issued against Canadevim Ltée for the period from May 1, 1998, to October 31, 2001. The appellant is therefore of the view that he financed Canadevim Ltée by challenging the assessment on its behalf, making him a creditor of Candevim Ltée with a claim against it, a claim that has turned out to be unrecoverable.

Analysis and conclusion

[7] The appellant’s position with respect to the fees incurred in the course of his challenge of the bankruptcy of Canadevim Ltée is that they are deductible because they were incurred for the purpose of earning income from property. The appellant submits that, since the beginning of the challenge of the petition in bankruptcy, his intention has always been consistent, namely, to obtain payment for the $1,200,000 in work performed on the golf course, allowing him to cover the debts of Canadevim Ltée. Once this amount was recovered, either in kind or by the taking in payment of the golf course, a motion for an annulment of the bankruptcy would have been presented for the ultimate purpose of earning a dividend from Canadevim Ltée. In short, the appellant’s ultimate purpose in incurring such fees was to receive dividends from Canadevim Ltée, namely, income from property. Counsel for the appellant had the following to say in this regard:

[translation]

Therefore, Mr. Lacroix, as a shareholder of Canadavim; his interest in Canadavim’s ability to collect payment for the work it had performed on the golf course comes right at the end of the process, with the potential to collect dividends. That is the benefit to him. That payment will result in a benefit. That is Mr. Lacroix’s interest in the matter.

So yes, he wants Canadavim to be paid, because then the creditors can be paid and the bankruptcy can be annulled. For his part, not only will all of the creditors be paid—and he is one of them—but he will also be able to collect a dividend from the profits.

[8] The relevant sections of the Act are paragraphs 18(1)(a), 18(1)(b) and 18(1)(h) and subsection 9(1), which read as follows:

18. (1) In computing the income of a taxpayer from a business or property no deduction shall be made in respect of

(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business or property;

(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part;

. . .

(h) personal or living expenses of the taxpayer, other than travel expenses incurred by the taxpayer while away from home in the course of carrying on the taxpayer’s business;

9. (1) Subject to this Part, a taxpayer’s income for a taxation year from a business or property is the taxpayer’s profit from that business or property for the year.

[9] A reading of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act indicates that this provision does not entitle the taxpayer to deduct expenses; to the contrary, it sets out a restriction, a general prohibition. Subsection 18(1) of the Act provides that “no deduction shall be made in respect of” the elements listed in computing the income of a taxpayer from a business or property. In addition to paragraph (a), examples include paragraph 18(1)(b), which lists payments on account of capital, and 18(1)(h), which lists personal or living expenses. It is not under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act that a taxpayer can deduct fees that he has incurred to earn income from a business or property. Rather, it is under subsection 9(1), which provides that the income from a business or property is the taxpayer’s “profit”. The word “profit” refers to the net profit, or the gross revenues minus any expenses incurred to earn them.

[10] It is clear that for a taxpayer to be able to deduct fees incurred under subsection 9(1) of the Act, he must first determine whether he has a source of income, either from a business or from property.

[11] I am of the view that the fees incurred by the appellant were not deductible, for the following reasons:

(i) First, I note that the appellant radically changed his position, in that he is now alleging that the fees were incurred not for the purpose of earning income from a business (as alleged in the Notices of Appeal), but instead for the purpose of earning income from property. This change in course, in itself, reveals something of the lack of seriousness of the appellant’s position, which raised serious doubts in my mind as to the appellant’s claimed intention, about which, moreover, no evidence was filed.

(ii) It should be noted that in order for the appellant to be able to deduct his incurred fees under subsection 9(1) of the Act, he must first determine whether he has a source of income, in this case from property. How can he claim, in this case, that he had incurred costs for the purpose of earning income from property when, at the time the fees were incurred, Canadevim (the supposed source of income from property) was bankrupt? In other words, the appellant in this case did not have a source of income from property at the time he incurred the fees because Canadevim was bankrupt at that moment. In any case, even if he had had a source of income from property, I would be of the view that the fees could not be deducted because of the prohibition set out at paragraph 18(1)(b) of the Act. In my opinion, these fees constituted payments on account of capital. It is clear from the evidence filed that the fees were incurred in order to preserve an asset, in this case for the purpose of preventing the bankruptcy of Canadevim Ltée. In other words, the appellant was fighting for the survival of his source of income. In my view, the appellant incurred the fees to preserve an enduring benefit.

[12] I am also of the view that the fees (incurred in the context of an appeal against a GST/HST assessment of Canadevim Ltée for the period from March 1, 1998, to October 31, 2001) are not deductible under paragraph 60(o) of the Act, given that they were not incurred in prosecuting an appeal in relation to an assessment under the Act.

[13] I find that the decisions relied upon by the appellant (see Kruco Inc. v. The Queen (T.C.C.), 98 DTC 1568; Evans v. M.N.R., [1960] SCR 391; Automobiles Jalbert Inc. c. Le Sous-Ministre du Revenu, 2005 CanLII 31513 (QC CQ); Stewart v. Her Majesty the Queen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 645; Couillard v. The Queen, 2004 TCC 805) are not relevant because none involved an entity (a source of income from a business or property) that was bankrupt. In other words, those decisions are distinguishable from the facts in this case.

Analysis of the alternative position

[14] I note immediately that the appellant has in no way explained how the fees incurred to challenge the bankruptcy of Canadevim Ltée could constitute a debt owing by the latter.

[15] To claim a business investment loss in relation to a debt owing, one must be a creditor. In this case, for the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the appellant was not owed a debt by Canadevim Ltée for the fees he had incurred:

(i) I will start by considering the appellant’s claims in relation to the bad debt allegedly arising from the fees that he says he incurred on behalf of Canadevim Ltée following the authorization he received under section 38 of the BIA to continue opposing the assessment. Section 38 reads as follows:

Proceeding by creditor when trustee refuses to act

38. (1) Where a creditor requests the trustee to take any proceeding that in his opinion would be for the benefit of the estate of a bankrupt and the trustee refuses or neglects to take the proceeding, the creditor may obtain from the court an order authorizing him to take the proceeding in his own name and at his own expense and risk, on notice being given the other creditors of the contemplated proceeding, and on such other terms and conditions as the court may direct.

Transfer to creditor

(2) On an order under subsection (1) being made, the trustee shall assign and transfer to the creditor all his right, title and interest in the chose in action or subject-matter of the proceeding, including any document in support thereof.

Benefits belong to creditor

(3) Any benefit derived from a proceeding taken pursuant to subsection (1), to the extent of his claim and the costs, belongs exclusively to the creditor instituting the proceeding, and the surplus, if any, belongs to the estate.

Trustee may institute proceeding

(4) Where, before an order is made under subsection (1), the trustee, with the permission of the inspectors, signifies to the court his readiness to institute the proceeding for the benefit of the creditors, the order shall fix the time within which he shall do so, and in that case the benefit derived from the proceeding, if instituted within the time so fixed, belongs to the estate.

In my view, section 38 of the BIA simply attributes to the applicant the necessary interest within the meaning of section 55 of the Code of Civil Procedure to take legal action. Section 38 does not have the effect of making the appellant an agent of the trustee. Because it flows from section 38 of the BIA that the appellant had continued opposing the assessment in his own name and at his own expense and risk, the appellant, pursuant to section 38 of the BIA, could not have become a creditor of Canadevim Ltée by incurring such fees. I believe that the purpose of the appellant’s opposition to the assessment was to avoid becoming personally liable as a director of Canadevim Ltée.

(ii) As for the fees incurred by the appellant to challenge the bankruptcy, I cannot see how the appellant could have become a creditor of Canadevim Ltée by virtue of having incurred such fees. The appellant has failed to demonstrate that the trustee had accepted or agreed that the fees so incurred by the appellant somehow constituted advances awarded to Canadevim Ltée.

[16] In any event, even if the appellant had obtained, after incurring such fees, the status of creditor, I am of the view that he would not have been entitled to claim in relation to this alleged bad debt a business investment loss under paragraph 39(1)(c) of the Act because he did not advance funds to a Canadian-controlled private corporation that was a small business corporation. I note in this respect that the evidence demonstrates that the fees were incurred between 2007 and 2010 and that Canadevim Ltée had been bankrupt since 2003. Therefore, at the time the advances were allegedly made, Canadevim Ltée was not a small business corporation.

[17] For these reasons,

(i) the appeal for the 2007 taxation year is dismissed;

(ii) the appeal for the 2008 taxation year is allowed such that the legal fees claimed are deductible up to $514.85;

(iii) the appeal for the 2009 taxation year is allowed such that the legal fees claimed are deductible up to $725.60; and

(iv) the appeal for the 2010 taxation year is dismissed.
