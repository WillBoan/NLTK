REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, Taxing Officer, T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing on August 23, 2013. It followed a Judgment of the Honourable Justice D’Arcy dated September 21, 2012, which dismissed the appeal from an assessment made pursuant the Excise Tax Act, with costs. The taxation of costs proceeded thirty minutes after the appointed time, without the participation of the Appellant. Ms. Roxanne Wong represented the Respondent.

[2] The counsel fees claimed on the Bill of Costs are in accordance with Schedule II, Tariff B of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and are allowed in the amount of $6,200.00, which includes $700.00 for this taxation of costs. The disbursements claimed were supported by copies of supporting documentation attached as Exhibits to the Affidavit of Yvonne Brown, sworn March 13, 2013, filed for use on this taxation of costs. I am satisfied that the disbursements claimed were necessary for the conduct of the proceeding and they are allowed in the amount of $1,348.46.

[3] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and the amount of $7,548.46 is allowed.
