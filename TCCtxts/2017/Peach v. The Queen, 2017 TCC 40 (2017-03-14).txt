REASONS FOR ORDER

Bocock J.

Background of this Order

[1] This Court originally heard the appeal of the Appellant in St. John’s, Newfoundland on August 21, 2014. Oral reasons for judgment were rendered by telephone conference on September 9, 2014. There were two bases of the Appellant’s, Mr. Peach’s, appeal before the Court. The first basis concerned Mr. Peach’s assertion that he incurred losses from a rental property for the 2009 and 2010 taxation years. The second basis of appeal concerned additional business losses from a financial consulting business for the same two taxation years. The Court dismissed the appeal in its entirety.

[2] Mr. Peach appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court of Appeal denied Mr. Peach’s appeal in respect of the rental losses. In respect of the financial consulting business losses, the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside that judgment of this Court and returned the matter to the Tax Court for a redetermination.

[3] Specifically, Trudel J.A., found and directed as follows:

[5] Under section 67, the Judge, without saying why, considered globally whether the expenses were reasonable and accepted that, as set out in the Minister’s assessment, some of the expenses should be allowed to the extent they matched the appellant’s commission income. He did not have regard to the particular expenses and the appellant’s explanation for them.

[6] Stewart makes it clear (at paragraph 57) that under section 67, unreasonable expenses can be eliminated or reduced to make them reasonable.

[7] We are not satisfied that the Judge asked himself that question, namely whether the actual expenses in this case were unreasonable and what reduction in the appellant’s claimed expenses might be necessary in order to be reasonable.

[8] As a result, the appeal will be allowed in part, with costs, the judgement of the Tax Court of Canada will be set aside with respect to the appellant’s business losses and returned to the Tax Court of Canada for redetermination of the section 67 issue.

[4] The Chief Justice of this Court directed that this judge hear and re-determine “whether the actual expenses in this case were unreasonable and what reduction in the Appellant’s claimed expense might be necessary in order to be reasonable.”

Process for Redetermination of Business Expenses

[5] After a conference call, parties’ counsel mutually agreed to submit further argument by written submissions. These written submissions, the audio CD of the original hearing and the direction of the Federal Court of Appeal constitute the basis for this re-determination order.

[6] Given the categories of expenses and the Federal Court of Appeal’s direction that particular expenses and Mr. Peach explanation for them be considered, the Court has employed a hopefully useful methodology. The Court has examined each particular category of expense, the evidence and testimony for each at the hearing and the subsequent written respective submissions of counsel. The Court has provided its related conclusions concerning the extent of unreasonableness, if any. Therefore, by deduction, the Court has determined the reasonable expenses which Mr. Peach may deduct from income in each year.

Legal Basis for Analysis

[7] In undertaking the redetermination, the Court uses the instruction provided in Stewart v. The Queen, 2002 SCC 46 at paragraph 57:

57 It is clear from these provisions that the deductibility of expenses presupposes the existence of a source of income, and thus should not be confused with the preliminary source inquiry. If the deductibility of a particular expense is in question, then it is not the existence of a source of income which ought to be questioned, but the relationship between that expense and the source to which it is purported to relate. The fact that an expense is found to be a personal or living expense does not affect the characterization of the source of income to which the taxpayer attempts to allocate the expense, it simply means that the expense cannot be attributed to the source of income in question. As well, if, in the circumstances, the expense is unreasonable in relation to the source of income, then s. 67 of the Act provides a mechanism to reduce or eliminate the amount of the expense. Again, however, excessive or unreasonable expenses have no bearing on the characterization of a particular activity as a source of income.

[8] In addition, poor business judgment should not be the primary basis which determines that business expenses are unreasonable, but rather, a conclusion that no person of business would pay such amount given the circumstances of the taxpayer before the Court: Ankrah v. R., 2003 TCC 413 at paragraph 4, itself citing Gabco Limited v. MNR, (1968), 68 DTC 5210 (Ex. CF) at page 5216.

[9] Moreover, any contemporenous assessment of reasonableness or unreasonableness cannot utilize a simple notion that expenses exceeded revenue: Williams v. R., 2009 TCC 93 at paragraphs 16 and 17. Logically, this conclusion exists for two reasons. First, the measure of revenue versus expenses is a quantifiable calculation which occurs after the fact. It cannot possibly be made at the time of the expenditure or even during the annual period of measure. Second, a business expenditure is by nature made to gain business income, thus is incurred beforehand, with its hopeful result of income unpredictably subsequent.

Analysis

[10] The Federal Court of Appeal requires that this Court review the facts concerning the unreasonableness (and by deduction reasonableness) of the additional business expenses by each category. Appropriately, the evidence of Mr. Peach was not considered in the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision. To that extent, counsels’ submissions have been received and filtered by this Court through the actual evidence, pleadings and documentary evidence before this Court at the hearing.

[11] Of particular note in that regard, are the following facts concerning the 2009 and 2010 taxation years adduced into evidence by Mr. Peach, either in his testimony in chief, his documents or on cross-examination:

[12] On the basis of the foregoing, the following represent, in the case of each heading of expense, an analysis grouped by categories of the unreasonableness and reasonableness of the claimed expenses.

Meals and Entertainment

Business Tax, Fees and Licenses

Office Expenses

Delivery Freight and Express

Capital Cost Allowance

Motor Vehicle Expense

Other Expenses

[13] Appellant’s counsel submits that receipts of this category of evidence were submitted to CRA in July 2012. This may well be. However, no evidence, either by way of documents or vive voce testimony, was submitted to this Court at trial. Nothing before the Court allows it to make any determination regarding this genre of expense. Such expenses are not allowed because no evidence of same exists. The pertains to the “other” category in 2009 and “travel” in 2010, neither of which were referred to in Mr. Peach’s testimony at the hearing.

[14] On the basis of the foregoing, the findings contained below represent this Court’s determination, on the facts, of the extent of the unreasonable expenses and, by deduction, the reasonable expenses that shall be allowed Mr. Peach for his business in the 2009 and 2010 taxation years. As a summary, the original expenses claimed, those which were unreasonable and those which are reasonable and allowed for the two taxation years are as follows:

Taxation Year

Re-determined Unreasonableness Expenses

Reasonable Expenses

2009

$6,191.00

$4,249.00

2010

$9,224.00

$3,694.00

[15] Mr. Peach shall be entitled to his costs in accordance with the tariff as if the matter were a two day informal appeal, subject to the right of either party to make further submissions in writing to the Court within 30 days of the date of this Order.

Signed at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 14th day of March 2017.
