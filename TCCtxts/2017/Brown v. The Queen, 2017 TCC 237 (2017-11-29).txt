[1] This is an appeal from reassessments dated July 20, 2015 made under the the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the “Act”), by the Minister of National Revenue (the “Minister”) concerning the appellant’s 2011 and 2012 taxation years.

[2] In computing his income for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years, the appellant reported, among other things, the following:

[8] The appellant testified at the hearing. He explained that, during the 2011 and 2012 taxation years, he was an employee of the Royal Bank of Canada and held the position of regional financial advisor. He was paid on a commission basis. He covered the territory of southern Alberta and was responsible for all his expenses. His only permanent office was at home in Lethbridge, Alberta. The Declaration of Conditions of Employment (Form T2200) which was completed by the RBC Royal Bank for each of the appellant’s 2011 and 2012 taxation years, were filed as evidence in court.

[9] During his testimony, he explained that in his professional career, he has been audited twice by the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) and that his claims for expenses for prior years were accepted by the CRA. To support his assertion, the appellant filed as an exhibit, Form T777, Comparative Summary of Employment Expenses for the 2007 to 2011 years inclusively. This time the situation is different because he lost all his documents when his house was flooded in July 2013.

[10] The only documentary evidence presented by the appellant concerning the flood, is a letter dated August 28, 2014 from Mr. Austin Stephens, a licensed broker of Young Insurance. The author of the letter says, among other things, on June 24, 2013, Young Insurance received a phone call from Mr. Lance Brown regarding a potential water damage claim to his dwelling and contents located at 6 Sheridan Place West, Lethbridge, Alberta and that Mr. Brown was advised not to submit a claim because seepage and flooding were not insured perils under his insurance policy. There would be no insurance coverage for the damage to his dwelling and its contents and Mr. Brown was responsible for the loss sustained. Mr. Stephens was not called as a witness at the hearing.

[11] Concerning the advertising and promotion expenses, the appellant explained that he had to give seminars with particular groups of interest. For this purpose, he had to rent space at a convenient location and advertise the events. The appellant also explained that he was giving approximately $1,000 per year to employees of the Royal Bank of Canada as rewards for referring potential clients to him. This was accomplished by remitting gift certificates of less than $100 each. He also stated that these expenses were not reimbursed by the Royal Bank of Canada.

[12] Concerning the motor vehicle expenses, the appellant claimed $13,915 in 2011 and $12,487 in 2012. CRA allowed $946.23 and $933.41 respectively. The appellant explained that he was driving 40,000 kilometres per year for business purposes and that his claim was based on 44 cents per kilometre, e.g. the rate used by the Royal Bank of Canada for its employees. The appellant was driving a 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander and was taking only a two-week vacation per year. His spouse, a high school teacher had her own car. The appellant explained that these motor vehicle expenses were not reimbursed by the Royal Bank of Canada except for the trips required by the bank. In 2011 and 2012, the appellant received motor vehicle allowances in the amounts of $396 and $408.32 respectively from the bank

[13] The appellant claimed meals and entertainment expenses in the amounts of $6,615 in 2011 and $6,048 in 2012 and the CRA allowed $1,507.78 in each year. The appellant explained that he was taking clients for lunch two or three times per week and also when he hosted seminars with prospective clients.

[14] The appellant claimed lodging expenses in the amounts of $1,461 in 2011 and $664 in 2012. The CRA allowed $541.06 in each year. The appellant conceded $554 to attend a football game in Seattle in 2011. The adjustments under litigation for 2011 and 2012 are $365.94 and $49.29 respectively. The appellant explained that he would spend the night away from home if the roads were closed due to bad weather conditions or if his seminars finished late.

[15] The appellant claimed office supplies in the amounts of $1,429 in 2011 and $517 in 2012. The CRA allowed $467.71 in each year. The appellant explained that these expenses were primarily for the purchase of a printer and a charger for his laptop

[16] The appellant also claimed expenses in relation to workspace-in-home in the amounts of $1,051 in 2011 and $1,060 in 2012. The CRA did not allow any of these amounts. The appellant explained that he was required to use a portion of his home for work as indicated in the Royal Bank of Canada’s Form T-2200 and he indicated 20% as the percentage of the duties he performed at his home office as estimated by the bank on the said form.

[17] The appellant also claimed $19,108 in 2011 and $19,583 in 2012 under “Other expenses” which were both disallowed by the CRA. The appellant explained that these amounts were paid to his daughter, Emily, and to his son, Evan, for services they provided at the home office. Their duties consisted of opening clients’ files, preparing documents for his signature, conducting research on competitive products and organizing mail for, among other things, transfers of funds. In 2011, Emily was paid $12,000 and Evan was paid $6,000. In 2012, Emily was paid $6,000 and Evan was paid $12,000. Payments were made in a number of ways which included cash payments and contributions to their Registered Retirement Savings Plans and to their Tax-Free Savings Accounts. According to the appellant, this was done after his accountant had consulted with the CRA on the issue. The appellant further alleged that the amounts paid to his children were reported as income in their respective tax returns and they paid Canada Pension Plan premiums on these amounts.

[18] The appellant explained that the revenues generated by his condominium unit located in Kimberley, British Columbia, were reported as income based on his one-half share and that the goods and services tax collected on the rent was remitted to the Receiver General of Canada. The gross rent reported in 2011 and 2012 were $1,449 and $1,189 respectively. In the course of the audit, the CRA determined that the gross rent were $5,933.39 and $4,789.60 respectively for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years. The reason for the adjustments was due to the fact that an amount of $300 was being deposited every month into a special bank account for the condominium operations. This amount was being deposited around the 24th of each month and is described as “transfer 42270002”.

[19] The appellant alleged that he had to transfer an after-tax amount into the rental property account to cover the shortfall in the condominium fees because the rental income was not sufficient to cover the condominium fees entirely. To support his allegations, the appellant filed as evidence, the rental property account for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years.

[20] As a result of the various concessions made by the parties, the rental expenses respecting the condominium are not contested anymore.

. . .

Analysis

[22] The income tax system is based on self-monitoring and the burden of proof for deductions and claims rests with the taxpayer. The taxpayer must have detailed information available and keep documentation in support of the claims he makes.

[23] In this instance, the books and records kept by the appellant were just non-existent allegedly due to a flood that occurred in his home office in July 2013. The only documentary evidence of the flood submitted by the appellant is a letter from his insurance broker dated one year after the event. The letter refers to the appellant’s phone call made to his insurance company in the month preceding the alleged flood. The insurance broker did not testify at the hearing to confirm whether or not he had personal knowledge of the call and if the information in the letter is true. The appellant could also have provided photos of the damages and copies of the invoices for repairs done to his dwelling which the appellant estimated to be in excess of $40,000.

[24] In the circumstances, I do not find the appellant’s testimony on this issue credible.

[25] The T2200 forms that were submitted as exhibits for the appellant’s 2011 and 2012 taxation years showed that the appellant was not required, under his contract of employment, to pay for an assistant. That form is a statutory condition precedent to the claiming of certain employment expense deductions and provides evidence of the terms of employment. The form is not conclusive or determinative if the evidence proves it to be wrong. Nevertheless, the requirement in subparagraph 8(1)(i)(ii) of the Act in respect of the salary paid to an assistant is only satisfied if it is essential that the expenditure be incurred in order for the appellant to carry out the duties of his employment.

[26] In this instance, the appellant has failed to meet his burden of proof on this point. The appellant’s testimony that his children’s duties consisted of opening client files, preparing documents for his signature, conducting research on competitive products and organizing mail, do not show that his children’s services were necessary for the appellant to be able to carry out the duties of his employment as a financial advisor.

[27] Furthermore, the appellant did not call his children to substantiate his testimony nor did he call his supervisor who would have been able to explain the reasons why his children’s assistance was implicitly required.

[28] Despite the fact that the appellant’s testimony indicated that his children may have genuinely provided some assistance, he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish the element of necessity. The appellant did not keep a record of the number of hours his children worked in any given year and he has admitted that the amounts paid to them were arbitrarily determined and have no correlation with the duties actually performed.

[29] Pursuant to subsection 8(13) of the Act, no amount is deductible in computing an individual’s income for a taxation year from an office or employment in respect of any part (the “work space”) of a self-contained domestic establishment in which the individual resides, except to the extent that the work space is either:

(i) the place where the individual principally performs the duties of the office or employment, or

(ii) used exclusively during the period for the purpose of earning income from the office or employment and used on a regular and continuous basis for meeting customers in the ordinary course of performing the duties of the office or employment.

[30] The forms T2200 submitted indicate that the appellant performed his duties of employment at home only 20% of the time and the appellant has admitted that he was not meeting clients at home. Consequently, the two conditions of subsection 8(13) are not met which means that no amount is deductible by the appellant in computing his income in respect of his work space-in-home.

[31] The forms T2200 submitted indicate that:

- the appellant was required to pay his own expenses while carrying out the duties of his employment;

- the appellant had no specific territory where he was required to travel during the course of performing the duties of his employment;

- the appellant was required to be away for at least 12 consecutive hours from the municipality where the appellant normally reported for work, 14 times in 2011 and 5 times in 2012; and

- the appellant received motor vehicle allowances of $396 in 2011 and $408.32 in 2012 which were not included in the appellant’s employment income by the Royal Bank of Canada.

[32] The appellant’s testimony is to the effect that he used one vehicle exclusively for employment purposes and that he drove 40,000 kilometres per year. The appellant claimed motor vehicle expenses totalling $13,915 and $12,487 for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years respectively, by using a rate of 44 cents per kilometre. The appellant did not maintain a mileage log with respect to the motor vehicle that he drove for employment purposes nor a list of clients or potential clients he met or of the seminars he gave while away from home. The appellant did not submit any invoice showing the real fuel and maintenance costs that he incurred in performing the duties of his employment.

[33] In the absence of any supportive receipt or any reasonable alternative method of calculating the motor vehicle expenses, I can only conclude that the amounts allowed by the Minister (net of the motor vehicle allowances paid by the Royal Bank of Canada are reasonable in the circumstances.

[34] The appellant claimed meals and entertainment expenses totalling $6,615 and $6,408 for the 2011 and 2012 taxations years respectively and the Minister allowed $1,507.78 per year. In the absence of a list of individuals who the appellant allegedly entertained and receipts and credit card statements, I can only conclude that the amounts allowed by the Minister are reasonable in the circumstances.

[35] The appellant claimed expenses for supplies totalling $1,429 and $517 for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years respectively and the Minister allowed $467.71 in each year. In the absence of invoices showing the purchases of capital items such as computers, monitors and printers, I can only conclude that the amounts allowed by the Minister are reasonable in the circumstances.

[36] The other employment expenses in respect of advertising and promotion, lodging and rental expenses respecting the condominium, claimed by the appellant, were adjusted as a result of concessions made by the parties. I do not intend to make changes to these items.

[37] Concerning the undeclared income generated by rental of the condominium, the appellant was given the opportunity to show the source of the $300 monthly deposits in his condominium bank account but he failed to provide any evidence that these deposits were made by transfers from his personal bank account. As an employee of the Royal Bank of Canada, I am persuaded that the appellant could have easy access to his banking documents.

[38] Based on the foregoing, the appellant failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he was entitled to adjustments other than those described above with respect to his 2011 and 2012 taxation years.
