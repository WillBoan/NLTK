FARM CREDIT CANADA,

Appellant,

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

D'Arcy J.

[1] The issue before the Court is whether, during the relevant reporting periods, the Appellant was a “loan corporation” for the purposes of the Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations (the “Attribution Regulations”) adopted pursuant to Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (the “GST Act”).

[2] Neither party called witnesses during the hearing. The parties filed a statement of agreed facts (“SAF”) and a joint book of documents (Exhibit AR1). The parties agreed that the documents could be taken as proof of the truth of their contents. The Respondent provided additional evidence by way of read-ins.

[3] The Appellant’s annual report for the fiscal period ending March 31, 2011 states that the Appellant “is a financially self-sustaining federal Crown corporation reporting to Parliament through the Minister of Agriculture and Minister for the Canadian Wheat Board.”[1]

[4] The SAF, attached as Appendix A to these Reasons for Judgment, provides information on the purpose and operations of the Appellant. The following paragraphs summarize this information.

[5] The Appellant’s purpose is to enhance rural Canada by providing specialized and personalized financial services to farming operations and enterprises that are closely related to, or dependent on, farming.

[6] The principal business of the Appellant is the lending of money.

[7] The Appellant is a corporation continued under the Farm Credit Canada Act[2] (the “FCCA”). It is not incorporated or continued under the federal Trust and Loan Companies Act[3] or under the relevant trust and loan corporation legislation of any province. In addition, it is not registered or licensed to carry on business as a loan corporation under the relevant provincial trust and loan corporation legislation.

[8] The statement of agreed facts notes that the Appellant is subject to federal oversight and federal statutory requirements, as set out below:

- The Appellant may be subject to a special examination by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions from time to time. The last special examination was conducted in respect of the period between December 11, 2012 and March 31, 2013.

- The FCCA imposes a maximum leverage requirement. The aggregate direct and contingent liabilities of the Appellant cannot, at any time, exceed twelve times the capital of the Appellant, except by order of the Governor in Council.

- The Appellant provides its annual corporate plan and financial results to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.

[9] The Appellant offers the following three product lines in its lending business:

1. primary production financing;

2. agribusiness and agri-food financing; and

3. FCC Alliances point-of-sale financing.

[10] Primary production financing is the making of loans to primary producers, such as grain farmers or dairy farmers, to purchase inputs such as land, equipment or supplies.

[11] Agribusiness and agri-food financing is the making of loans to suppliers or processors who do business with primary producers. Examples of the Appellant’s customers in this category are equipment manufacturers and dealers, food processors (such as meatpackers) and input providers (such as seed wholesalers).

[12] FCC Alliances point-of-sale financing involves the Appellant entering into agreements with so-called alliance partners such as crop input suppliers, agricultural equipment dealers, and cattle dealers. In this form of financing, a primary producer seeks to make a purchase (or to lease) from an alliance partner. The primary producer seeks financing for the purchase from the Appellant, with the alliance partner operating as an intermediary.

[13] In addition to its lending activities, the Appellant has the following revenue-generating activities:

a. direct and indirect investment in commercialization-to-growth-stage businesses operating in various agricultural sectors;

b. the offering of loan, credit life, and accident insurance products administered by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada; and

c. the sale of farm management software.

[14] The Appellant’s annual reports for its fiscal years ending March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 evidence that the Appellant’s net interest income after provision for credit losses comprises approximately 98% of its net income before administration expenses.[4]

[15] The statement of agreed facts does not state where in Canada the Appellant carries on its business. However, the Appellant’s annual reports note that the Appellant operates from 100 offices located in each of Canada’s ten provinces.[5]

[16] The Respondent, in her written submissions, argues that I should quash the appeals in respect of the Appellant’s GST reporting periods ending on March 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010. I agree, for the following reasons.

[17] The Appellant is an annual filer for the purposes of the GST Act. It is appealing reassessments in respect of its annual GST reporting periods ending on March 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

[18] The Minister assessed each of these reporting periods as follows:

- Annual reporting period ending on March 31, 2009, net tax of $224,131.74.

- Annual reporting period ending on March 31, 2010, net tax of $397,095.08.

- Annual reporting period ending on March 31, 2011, net tax of $2,537,716.99.

[19] The parties agree that, if the Court finds that the Appellant is a “loan corporation” under the Attribution Regulations, the Minister has assessed the correct amount of net tax for each of these reporting periods.[6]

[20] In addition, the parties agree[7] that, if the Court finds that the Appellant was a “general corporation” under the Attribution Regulations, the net tax of the Appellant for each of the reporting periods would be as follows:

- Annual reporting period ending on March 31, 2009, net tax of $267,611.74.

- Annual reporting period ending on March 31, 2010, net tax of $454,968.08.

- Annual reporting period ending on March 31, 2011, net tax of $2,022,265.99.

[21] The difficulty I have with the agreement reached by the parties is that the Appellant is not asking me to reduce the net tax assessed for its GST reporting periods ending on March 31, 2009 and on March 31, 2010. The Appellant and the Respondent are telling me that, if I find that the Appellant is a “loan corporation”, the assessments for those two reporting periods are correct and if I find that the Appellant is a “general corporation”, I should increase the assessments for those two reporting periods.

[22] While the Court can issue a judgment confirming the Minister’s assessment of net tax for a reporting period (by dismissing the appeal), it cannot issue a judgment increasing the amount of net tax the Minister has assessed for a reporting period. The Respondent cannot appeal her own assessment, which would be the result if I increased the amount of the net tax assessed.

[23] As a result, the Appellant’s appeals with respect to its reporting periods ending on March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010 are quashed. The only reporting period properly before the Court is the Appellant’s reporting period ending on March 31, 2011.

[24] The Attribution Regulations are part of what is generally referred to as the special attribution method (the “SAM Rules”) that applies to certain financial institutions. As the Appellant noted in its written submissions, the SAM Rules are very complex. This complexity is exacerbated by the fact that the SAM Rules were amended during the reporting period at issue, with very unusual effective dates for the amendments.

[25] However, one must understand the various statutory provisions that comprise the SAM Rules in order to determine the meaning of the words “loan corporation” as those words are used in the Attribution Regulations.

[26] I will begin my discussion of the law by summarizing the general operation of the GST Act. This discussion is required in order to provide context for the SAM Rules. I will then discuss, in detail, the operation of the SAM Rules.

[27] The GST is levied under four separate and distinct divisions of the GST Act: Division II, Division III, Division IV, and Division IV.1.

[28] Division II tax is levied under subsections 165(1) and (2) of the GST Act. Those subsections read as follows:

(1) Subject to this Part, every recipient of a taxable supply made in Canada shall pay to Her Majesty in right of Canada tax in respect of the supply calculated at the rate of 5% of the value of the consideration for the supply.

(2) Subject to this Part, every recipient of a taxable supply made in a participating province shall pay to Her Majesty in right of Canada, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection (1), tax in respect of the supply calculated at the tax rate for that province on the value of the consideration for the supply.

[29] The effect of subsections 165(1) and (2) is to levy a single federal value added tax (the “GST”) at multiple rates on the recipient of taxable supplies made in Canada: the 5% rate for supplies made in so-called non-participating provinces[8] (the “GST rate”) and the various higher rates imposed on supplies made in so-called participating provinces that are subject to tax under both subsections 165(1) and (2) (the “HST rate(s)”).

[30] Schedule VIII to the GST Act contains the actual rates at which the tax is imposed under subsection 165(2) (the “Sch. VIII provincial tax rate(s)”).

[31] Between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2011 (the relevant period), the Division II tax was levied at the following rates:

- During all of the relevant period, the Division II tax was levied at the 5% GST rate on supplies that were determined to be made in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island.

- During all of the relevant period, the Division II tax was levied at a 13% HST rate on supplies that were determined to be made in either New Brunswick or Newfoundland. The 13% HST rate was comprised of the 5% rate levied under subsection 165(1) and an 8% Sch. VIII provincial tax rate levied under subsection 165(2) on supplies made in New Brunswick and Newfoundland.

- Prior to July 2010, the Division II tax was levied at a 13% HST rate on supplies that were determined to be made in Nova Scotia; the rate increased to a 15% HST rate for supplies made after June 2010. The increase in the HST rate was a result of the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for supplies made in Nova Scotia increasing from 8% to 10% effective July 1, 2010.

- Prior to July 2010, the Division II tax was levied at the 5% GST rate on supplies that were determined to be made in British Colombia; the rate increased to a 12% HST rate for such supplies made after June 2010. The increase was a result of the addition of British Columbia as a participating province under the GST Act on July 1, 2010, the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for that province being 7%.

- Prior to July 2010, the Division II tax was levied at the 5% GST rate on supplies that were determined to be made in Ontario; the rate increased to a 13% HST rate for such supplies made after June 2010. The increase was a result of the addition of Ontario as a participating province under the GST Act on July 1, 2010, the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for that province being 8%.

[32] The recipient of a taxable supply pays the Division II tax to the GST registrant who supplied the property or service. The supplier then remits the Division II tax to the government.

[33] Division III tax is levied under section 212 at the 5% GST rate on all goods imported into Canada. In addition, under section 212.1, a resident of a participating province will pay additional Division III tax at the relevant Sch. VIII provincial tax rate on non-commercial goods imported into Canada. The Canada Border Services Agency collects the Division III tax at the time the goods are imported into Canada.

[34] Division IV tax at the 5% GST rate is levied under section 218 on certain services and intangible personal property imported into Canada. Subsection 218.1(1) levies Division IV tax at the relevant Sch. VIII provincial tax rate on such supplies that a person imports for consumption or use or supply in one or more of the participating provinces.

[35] Division IV tax is also levied under section 218.01 at the 5% GST rate on certain financial institutions in respect of internal charges.[9] Subsection 218.1(1.2) levies the Division IV tax at the relevant Sch. VIII provincial rate on such financial institutions that are resident in a participating province. The rules with respect to the imposition of Division IV tax under sections 218.01 and 218.1(1.2) are extremely complex. The provisions apply in certain situations to financial institutions that carry on their activities inside and outside of Canada, normally through branches.

[36] Generally speaking, Division IV tax is only levied if the services or intangible personal property are not subject to tax under Division II and are imported for use wholly or partly in GST non-commercial activities. The recipient of the supply of the imported service or intangible personal property pays the Division IV tax on a self-assessing basis.

[37] Division IV.1 tax is levied on property and services brought into a participating province. The tax is levied at the relevant Sch. VIII provincial tax rate. Similar to Division IV tax, Division IV.1 tax, generally speaking, only applies to property and services brought into a participating province for use wholly or partly in GST non-commercial activities. The tax is paid on a self‑assessing basis.

[38] Subsection 169(1), contains the general rules for the claiming of input tax credits in respect of GST paid on the acquisition or importation of property or services, or on the bringing of the property or services into a participating province. The subsection applies to all tax imposed under any of the four Divisions of the GST Act.[10]

[39] Generally speaking, subsection 169(1) allows a GST registrant to claim an input tax credit for GST paid to the extent that the registrant acquired or imported the property or service, or brought it into a participating province, for consumption, use, or supply in the course of the person’s GST commercial activities.

[40] For example, a GST registrant is entitled to claim a full input tax credit for the GST paid on the acquisition of property or a service if it acquired the property or service for use only in its GST commercial activities. However, if a registrant, such as a financial institution, acquired the property or service for use in the proportion of 30% in GST commercial activities and 70% in the course of making exempt supplies (a GST non-commercial activity), then it is only entitled to claim an input tax credit for 30% of the GST paid on the acquisition of the property or service.

[41] A GST registrant is required to calculate and remit its net tax for each of its GST reporting periods. The net tax of a person for a specific reporting period is determined under subsection 225(1). Generally speaking, the net tax of a person for a specific reporting period is all amounts that became collectible and all other amounts collected by the person in the particular reporting period as or on account of Division II tax minus input tax credits claimed in the GST return filed by the person.

[42] The GST registrant is also required to remit any tax it is required to self-assess under Divisions IV and IV.1. The registrant remits the Division IV and IV.1 tax with its net tax for the GST reporting period in which the Division IV and IV.1 tax became payable.[11]

[43] As discussed previously, the Canada Border Services Agency collects the Division III tax at the time the goods are imported into Canada.

[44] A significant portion of a financial institution’s business is comprised of exempt activities. As a result, it is not entitled to recover, by way of input tax credits, all of the GST it pays on the acquisition or importation of property or services. The imposition of the GST at multiple rates raises issues for financial institutions that carry on business in both participating and non-participating provinces. Absent special rules, such financial institutions would be able to minimize the amount of non-recoverable GST they pay at the higher HST rate by purchasing and consuming goods and services in non-harmonized provinces at the lower 5% GST rate. This would potentially reduce investment in the participating provinces.

[45] The government recognized this issue at the time the first provinces elected to become participating provinces. As a result, it developed the SAM Rules for financial institutions that carry on business in both participating and non-participating provinces. The SAM Rules are intended to result in the location of a financial institution’s purchases or importations of goods and services not affecting the amount of non-recoverable GST payable by the financial institution at the HST rate. The Department of Finance referred to this objective as being “to avoid the HST creating a bias in terms of where an SLFI [selected listed financial institution] sources its inputs”.[12]

[46] There are four components of the SAM Rules. First, certain financial institutions are defined to be selected listed financial institutions (“SLFI”). Second, statutory adjustments are made to the tax payable by an SLFI under Divisions IV and IV.1 at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate. Third, an SLFI is not entitled to claim input tax credits in respect of the portion of the GST paid at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate. Fourth, adjustments are made to the SLFI’s net tax for a specific reporting period.

[47] The SAM Rules only apply to SLFIs. The term SLFI is defined in subsection 225.2(1). The definition was amended in respect of any reporting period of a person that ends on or after July 1, 2010 (the “July 1, 2010 Amendment”). The July 1, 2010 Amendment coincided with Ontario and British Columbia becoming participating provinces. I will refer to subsection 225.2(1) as it read prior to the July 1, 2010 Amendment as “old subsection 225.2(1)”. I will refer to the subsection as it read after the July 1, 2010 Amendment as “new subsection 225.2(1)”.

[48] As I will discuss, certain sections of the Attribution Regulations apply when determining whether a person is an SLFI. In addition to subsection 225.2(1) being amended upon Ontario and British Columbia becoming participating provinces, substantial changes were made to the Attribution Regulations. In fact new regulations were introduced (the “New Attribution Regulations”) replacing the previous regulations (the “Old Attribution Regulations”). Any reference in these reasons for judgment to the Attribution Regulations is a reference to both the New Attribution Regulations and the Old Attribution Regulations.

[49] Old subsection 225.2(1) read as follows, as it applied to financial institutions that were corporations:

(1) For the purposes of this Part, a financial institution is a selected listed financial institution throughout a reporting period in a fiscal year that ends in a particular taxation year of the financial institution if the financial institution is a listed financial institution described in any of subparagraphs 149(1)(a)(i) to (x) during the particular year and the preceding taxation year and

(a) the financial institution is a corporation that, under the rules prescribed in any of sections 402 to 405 of the Income Tax Regulations, has or would, if it had taxable income for the particular year and the preceding taxation year, have taxable income earned in the particular year and the preceding taxation year in any of the participating provinces and taxable income earned in the particular year and the preceding taxation year in any of the non-participating provinces;

. . .

(d) the financial institution is a prescribed financial institution.

[50] As a result, under old subsection 225.2(1) a financial institution that was a corporation had to satisfy the following two conditions before it was deemed to be an SLFI:

• It had to be a financial institution that was a listed financial institution described in any of subparagraphs 149(1)(a)(i) to (x), and

• It must either have been required, under the Income Tax Regulations, to allocate taxable income to both a participating and a non-participating province or be a prescribed institution. Section 2 of the Old Attribution Regulations provides that certain financial institutions are prescribed financial institutions for the purposes of old subsection 225.2(1).

[51] New subsection 225.2(1) reads as follows, as it applies to financial institutions that are corporations:

For the purposes of this Part, a financial institution is a selected listed financial institution throughout a reporting period in a fiscal year that ends in a taxation year of the financial institution if the financial institution is

(a) a listed financial institution described in any of subparagraphs 149(1)(a)(i) to (x) during the taxation year; and

(b) a prescribed financial institution throughout the reporting period.

[52] New subsection 225.2(1) retains the first condition in old subsection 225.2(1), namely, that the financial institution be a listed financial institution under subparagraphs 149(1)(a)(i) to (x ), but replaces the second condition in old subsection 225.2(1) - i.e., that the financial institution either be required to allocate income under the Income Tax Regulations or be a prescribed institution under section 2 of the Old Attribution Regulations - with the requirement that the financial institution be a prescribed financial institution. Section 9 of the new Attribution Regulations provides that certain financial institutions are prescribed financial institutions for the purposes of new subsection 225.2(1).

[53] With respect to the first condition, listed financial institution is defined in subsection 123(1) to mean a person referred to in paragraph 149(1)(a), which defines financial institution. Paragraph 149(1)(a) contains subparagraphs (i) to (xi). An SLFI is defined to only include the listed financial institutions mentioned in subparagraphs (i) to (x) of paragraph 149(1)(a), which are the following:

(i) a bank,

(ii) a corporation that is licensed or otherwise authorized under the laws of Canada or a province to carry on in Canada the business of offering to the public its services as a trustee,

(iii) a person whose principal business is as a trader or dealer in, or as a broker or salesperson of, financial instruments or money,

(iv) a credit union,

(v) an insurer or any other person whose principal business is providing insurance under insurance policies,

(vi) a segregated fund of an insurer,

(vii) the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation,

(viii) a person whose principal business is the lending of money or the purchasing of debt securities or a combination thereof,

(ix) an investment plan, [and]

(x) a person providing services referred to in section 158.

[54] Paragraph 4 of the SAF states that the “principal business of the Appellant is the making of loans”. As a result, the Appellant satisfies the first requirement of old subsection 225.2(1) and new subsection 225.2(1) since it is a financial institution that is a listed financial institution described in subparagraph 149(1)(a)(viii), being a person whose principal business is the lending of money.

[55] With respect to the second condition in subsection 225.2(1), I will first consider that condition as stated in old subsection 225.2(1).

[56] Under old subsection 225.2(1), a financial institution satisfied the second condition if it was required under sections 402 to 405 of the Income Tax Regulations to allocate taxable income to both a participating and a non-participating province or was a prescribed financial institution.

[57] Under section 402 of the Income Tax Regulations, the financial institution will only be required to allocate income to a particular province if it has a permanent establishment in the province. Subsection 400(2) of the Income Tax Regulations defines permanent establishment as, generally speaking, a fixed place of business.

[58] It is my understanding that the Appellant, as a Crown corporation, does not pay provincial income tax and therefore does not fall within sections 402 to 405 of the Income Tax Regulations. As a result, it did not satisfy the second condition contained in paragraph (a) of old subsection 225.2(1).

[59] However, the second condition would also be satisfied if the Appellant was a prescribed financial institution under the Attribution Regulations.

[60] Under section 2 of the Old Attribution Regulations, a financial institution is a prescribed financial institution for the purposes of paragraph (d) of old subsection 225.2(1), if the financial institution is named in Schedule III of the Financial Administration Act and, if it were required to pay tax under the Income Tax Act, it would be required to allocate income to a participating province and a non-participating province under the allocation rules in sections 402 to 405 of the Income Tax Regulations.[13]

[61] The Appellant is named in Schedule III of the Financial Administration Act and the Appellant conceded in its written argument that it was a prescribed person under section 2 of the Old Attribution Regulations.

[62] In summary, the Appellant satisfied the first and second conditions under old subsection 225.2(1) and was a selected listed financial institution under old subsection 225.2(1).

[63] I will now consider the second condition under the new subsection 225.2(1). The second condition is satisfied if the financial institution is a prescribed financial institution under section 9 of the New Attribution Regulations. Under section 9 of the New Attribution Regulations, a financial institution, such as the Appellant, is a prescribed financial institution for the purposes of the definition of SLFI if it has a permanent establishment in a participating province and a permanent establishment in any other province. That section reads as follows,

Subject to sections 10 to 15 and for the purpose of paragraph 225.2(1)(b) of the Act, a financial institution is a prescribed financial institution throughout a reporting period in a particular fiscal year that ends in a taxation year of the financial institution if the financial institution

(a) has, at any time in the taxation year, a permanent establishment in a participating province and has, at any time in the taxation year, a permanent establishment in any other province; or

(b) is a qualifying partnership during the taxation year.

[64] Subsection 1(1) of the New Attribution Regulations defines permanent establishment of a person for the purposes of the New Attribution Regulations. That subsection defines permanent establishment of a corporation to mean any permanent establishment determined under subsection 400(2) of the Income Tax Regulations and any permanent establishment that entity is deemed to have under section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations. As a result, a selected listed financial institution that is a corporation will be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a province if it has a fixed place of business in the province (i.e., a permanent establishment under subsection 400(2) of the Income Tax Regulations) or is deemed to have a permanent establishment under section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations.

[65] Section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations contains rules that deem certain financial institutions to have a permanent establishment in a specific province. Paragraph 3(a) sets out a rule that deems a bank to have permanent establishments in certain provinces on the basis of where deposits held by the bank, property securing loans issued by the bank, or borrowers in respect of unsecured loans issued by the bank are located. Paragraph 3(b) deems an insurer to have permanent establishments in certain provinces by virtue of the location of property and persons insured by the insurer. Paragraph 3(c) contains a deeming rule for trust and loan corporations, trust corporations or loan corporations. The paragraph deems such entities to have a permanent establishment in certain provinces on the basis of where property securing loans issued by the entity, borrowers in respect of unsecured loans issued by the entity, or non-loan business carried on by the entity are located. Paragraphs 3(d), (e), and (f) extend the meaning of permanent establishment for a segregated fund of an insurer, a distributed investment plan and a private investment plan.

[66] Section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations extends the meaning of permanent establishment by looking past the physical fixed place of business of an entity to see if the entity is earning income in provinces where it does not have a physical fixed place of business. For example, under paragraph 3(c) of the New Attribution Regulations a financial institution that is a trust and loan corporation, a trust corporation or a loan corporation will be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a province if a loan that was made by the financial institution is outstanding and is secured by land situated in the province, or, if not secured by land, is owing by a person resident in the province, or if the financial institution conducts business (other than business in respect of loans) in the province. The financial institution is deemed to have a permanent establishment in the province even if it does not have a fixed place of business in that province. As a result of these new provisions, financial institutions that only have a single fixed place of business may still be deemed to be SLFIs.

[67] The backgrounder issued by the Department of Finance with respect to the New Attribution Regulations explains that section 3 is being added to ensure that a financial institution that carries on business across Canada, including in one or more participating provinces, is an SLFI even if it only has one fixed place of business.

[68] The New Attribution Regulations have unusual effective dates. Section 9 applies in respect of a reporting period that ends on or after July 1, 2010. The definition of permanent establishment in subsection 1(1) applies in respect of reporting periods that end on or after July 1, 2010, except that references to investment plans in paragraphs (a) and (b) are to be ignored as is paragraph (c), for reporting periods in a fiscal year that ends in a taxation year of the financial institution that begins before May 3, 2013.

[69] Section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations has two effective dates. The deeming provisions with respect to banks, segregated funds of an insurer, distributed investment plans and private investment plans apply in respect of a reporting period of a person that ends on or after July 1, 2010. However, the deeming provisions with respect to insurers, trust and loan corporations, trust corporations and loan corporations only apply in respect of a reporting period in a fiscal year of a person that begins on or after July 1, 2010.

[70] The reporting period of the Appellant that is before the Court began on April 1, 2010 and ended on March 31, 2011. Since this reporting period ended after June, 2010, new subsection 225.2(1) applies when determining whether the Appellant was an SLFI during the reporting period. As I have already discussed, the Appellant satisfied the first condition of new subsection 225.2(1) since it is a listed financial institution described in paragraph 149(1)(a)(viii).

[71] The second condition of new subsection 225.2(1) is satisfied if the Appellant is a prescribed financial institution under section 9 of the New Attribution Regulations. The Appellant was a prescribed financial institution during the reporting period at issue if it had a permanent establishment in a participating province and a permanent establishment in a non-participating province.

[72] The determination of where the Appellant had a permanent establishment will be made under subsection 1(1) of the New Attribution Regulations, since paragraph (b) of the definition of permanent establishment applies to reporting periods that end after June, 2010. However, paragraph 3(c) of the New Attribution Regulations, which extends the meaning of permanent establishment for “loan corporations”, will not apply to the Appellant even if I do determine that the Appellant was a “loan corporation” during the relevant period. This is the result since paragraph 3(c) of the New Attribution Regulations only applies to reporting periods of the Appellant that begin on or after July 1, 2010. The reporting period at issue began on April 1, 2010.

[73] Thus, the Appellant will satisfy the second condition as it had a fixed place of business in participating and non-participating provinces. The evidence before me is that the Appellant had fixed places of business in participating and non-participating provinces since it conducted its business through offices located in each of the 10 provinces.

[74] In summary, the Appellant was an SLFI during the reporting period before the Court.

[75] The second component of the SAM Rules, namely, adjustments to the tax payable by an SLFI, is set out in subsection 218.1(2) for Division IV tax and section 220.04 for Division IV.1 tax.

[76] Subsection 218.1(2) provides that SLFIs do not self-assess the Division IV tax imposed under subsections 218.1(1) and (1.2) at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate.[14]

[77] Section 220.04 provides that SLFIs do not self-assess the tax imposed under Division IV.1 at the relevant Sch. VIII provincial tax rate.[15]

[78] The result of these two sections is that SLFIs pay GST under the various divisions of the GST Act as follows:

- SLFIs pay Division II tax under subsections 165(1) and 165(2) at either the 5% GST rate, or the relevant HST rate, depending on whether the supply is made in a participating province or a non-participating province;

- SLFIs pay Division III tax under section 212 at the 5% GST rate on goods imported in the commercial stream and, under sections 212 and 212.1, at the relevant HST rate on goods that are not imported in the commercial stream; and

- SLFIs self-assess Division IV tax under sections 218 and 218.01 at the 5% GST rate.

[79] As a result, an SLFI only pays tax at the HST rate under Division II and Division III. It is not required, under Division IV and Division IV.1, to self-assess tax at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate.

[80] The third component of the SAM Rules is set out in subsection 169(3). The subsection provides that an SLFI is not entitled to claim input tax credits for the portion of the HST imposed at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate under Division II (subsection 165(2)) and under Division III (section 212.1).[16] As a result, an SLFI can only claim input tax credits at the 5% GST rate for any tax it has paid under Divisions II, III and IV.[17]

[81] In summary, when calculating its net tax under the general rules in subsection 225(1), the SLFI includes tax collected at both the GST rate and the HST rate,[18] however it only claims input tax credits for tax paid at the GST rate. This is the result even if it paid Division II and/or Division III tax at the higher HST rate. In addition, the SLFI is only required to self-assess Division IV tax at the GST rate, even if it imports intangible personal property or services for consumption in a participating province. Finally, the SLFI is not required to self-assess Division IV.1 tax on property and/or services it brings into a participating province for use in non-commercial activities.

[82] The fourth component of the SAM Rules, subsection 225.2(2), compensates for the departures from the “standard” GST rules with respect to Division IV and IV.1 tax payable and the claiming of input tax credits. It operates by adjusting the SLFI’s net tax determined under the general rules in 225(1).

[83] Specifically, the SLFI, when determining its net tax for a specific reporting period, adds to or deducts from the amount determined under subsection 225 (1) the amount determined by the formula [(A-B) x C x (D/E)] - F + G.[19]

[84] The SLFI performs a separate subsection 225.2(2) calculation for each participating province. The following describes the calculation for a specific participating province.

[85] The first calculation is (A-B).

[86] A is defined as the total of all tax payable by the SLFI under subsection 165(1) and sections 212, 218 and 218.01 in the reporting period.[20] This is all the Division II, III and IV tax the SLFI paid at the 5% GST rate.

[87] B is defined as all of the input tax credits claimed by the SLFI in its GST return for the specific reporting period.[21] As discussed previously, the SLFI is only entitled to claim input tax credits for tax paid at the 5% GST rate.

[88] As a result, A-B represents the tax the SLFI paid at the 5% GST rate that is not recoverable by the claiming of an input tax credit (the Non-recoverable 5% Tax).

[89] C is a percentage determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Attribution Regulations. The percentage is determined for the specific participating province and represents the allocation of a portion of the SLFI’s Non-recoverable 5% Tax to the specific participating province. I will refer to the percentage as the “Attribution Percentage”.

[90] The next calculation is (D/E). D is the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific participating province and E is the rate set out in subsection 165(1). The effect of multiplying the portion of the Non-recoverable 5% Tax allocated to the specific participating province by D/E is to grossup the allocated Non-recoverable 5% Tax to the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific participating province. The result is the amount of non-recoverable tax the SLFI should pay at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific province.

[91] F represents the amount of tax that became payable, or was paid by the SLFI without having become payable, under either subsection 165(2) (Division II tax) or under section 212.1 (Division III tax) at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific participating province. F is intended to give the SLFI credit for the tax it became liable to pay, or that it did pay, during the relevant reporting period at the relevant Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific participating province.[22]

[92] G represents prescribed adjustments. It includes such things as section 232 price adjustments and recaptures of input tax credits under sections 235 and 236.

[93] In summary, the calculation operates as follows:

- A separate calculation is done for each participating province.

- The SLFI first determines its Non-recoverable 5% Tax, i.e., the amount of non-recoverable tax it has paid at the 5% GST rate on all of its purchases and importations of goods and services.

- It then allocates a portion of its Non-recoverable 5% Tax to the specific participating province using the Attribution Percentage.

- The amount of the allocated Non-recoverable 5% Tax is then grossedup to reflect the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific province. The grossed-up amount reflects the amount of non-recoverable tax the SLFI is required to pay at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific province.

- The SLFI then reduces this amount by the amount of tax it has actually paid at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific province.

- The result is then added or subtracted from its net tax determined under subsection 225(1), which only allows the SLFI to recover tax (i.e., claim input tax credits) at the 5% GST rate.

- If the result is positive, the SLFI must add the amount to its net tax determined under subsection 225(1), since it has not paid all of the non-recoverable tax it should pay at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific province. If the result is negative, it will subtract the amount from its net tax determined under subsection 225(1), since it will have overpaid tax it should pay at the Sch. VIII provincial tax rate for the specific province.

- The SLFI then repeats the exercise for all participating provinces.

[94] The Department of Finance explained the effect of the net tax adjustment under subsection 225.2(2) as follows:

The net tax adjustments provided for under the special attribution method serve as a proxy for the appropriate amount of provincial component of the HST that should be borne by an SLFI on property and services consumed by it in its exempt activities undertaken in relation to the HST provinces, while avoiding the complexity of detailed tracking.[23]

[95] In other words, the result of subsection 225.2(2) is that the amount of non-recoverable tax that the SLFI pays at the HST rates is not determined by where the SLFI purchases the goods or services, but rather by the various Attribution Percentages determined under the Attribution Regulations.

[96] The Attribution Percentage for a specific participating province is meant to be an estimate of the percentage of the total taxable goods and services that an SLFI acquired or imported into Canada in a specific reporting period and that it consumed in the participating province.

[97] The issue before the Court is how the Appellant determines, under the Attribution Regulations, the Attribution Percentages.

[98] The Attribution Percentages are determined under Part 2 of the Attribution Regulations. The regulations provide separate rules for individuals, corporations and partnerships.

[99] I will first summarize the determination of the Attribution Percentages under the Old Attribution Regulations.

[100] With respect to corporations, the general rule is provided in section 8 of the Old Attribution Regulations. Sections 9, 10 and 11 provide special rules for insurance corporations, banks, trust and loan corporations, trust corporations and loan corporations.

[101] If the SLFI was a corporation that was not subject to the special rules in sections 9, 10 and 11, it determined its Attribution Percentage for a specific period and for a specific participating province in which the SLFI had a permanent establishment using the general rule in section 8 of the Old Attribution Regulations. Section 8 determined the Attribution Percentage using a formula that was based on the gross revenue of the corporation that was reasonably attributable to the permanent establishment of the SLFI and on the salaries and wages paid by the SLFI to employees of the permanent establishment.

[102] If the SLFI was an insurance company, its Attribution Percentage for a specific period for a specific participating province in which the insurance company had a permanent establishment was calculated under section 9 of the Old Attribution Regulations. The calculation was based upon net premiums in respect of insurance on property situated in the province and upon net premiums in respect of insurance, other than on property, from contracts with persons resident in the province.

[103] Under section 10 of the Old Attribution Regulations, an SLFI that was a bank calculated its Attribution Percentage for a specific participating province in which the bank had a permanent establishment, using a calculation based upon the salaries and wages it paid to employees of its permanent establishments located in that province and upon the loans and deposits of its permanent establishments in the participating province.

[104] Section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations applied to trust and loan corporations, trust corporations and loan corporations. Such a corporation based its calculation of the Attribution Percentage for a specific participating province in which the corporation had a permanent establishment on gross revenue from loans secured by lands situated in the participating province, from loans, not secured by land, made to persons residing in the participating province, from certain loans administered by the permanent establishment, and from business conducted at the permanent establishment that did not relate to loans.

[105] Part 2 of The New Attribution Regulations provides new regulations for the determination of the Attribution Percentages. The rules in sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations are replaced by new rules in sections 23, 24, 25, and 26 of the New Attribution Regulations.

[106] Section 23 of the New Attribution Regulations contains the general rule for a corporation that is not subject to one of the special rules. Section 23 sets out a formula that is nearly identical to the formula contained in section 8 of the Old Attribution Regulations.

[107] The new formulas used to calculate the Attribution Percentage for insurance companies, banks, trust and loan corporations, trust corporations and loan corporations are contained in sections 24, 25 and 26 of the New Attribution Regulations. While the new formulas are different than the formulas contained in the Old Attribution Regulations, the criteria used in the formulas have, generally speaking, been retained.

[108] The Attribution Percentage for insurance companies is still based upon net premiums in respect of insurance on property situated in the participating province and net premiums in respect of insurance, other than on property, from contracts with persons resident in the province.[24] The Attribution Percentage for banks is still based upon the salaries and wages paid by a bank to employees of its permanent establishments located in the participating province and upon the loans and deposits of its permanent establishments in the participating province.[25] The Attribution Percentage for trust and loan corporations, trust corporations and loan corporations is still based upon gross revenue from loans secured by lands situated in the participating province, upon loans, not secured by land, made to persons residing in the participating province, upon certain loans administered by the permanent establishment, and upon business conducted at the permanent establishment that does not relate to loans.[26]

[109] The New Attribution Regulations add lengthy and complex new rules for determining the Attribution Percentages for investment plans, including separate rules for stratified investment plans, non-stratified investment plans, exchange-traded funds, and pension plans and private investment plans.[27]

[110] The provisions containing the new formulas for calculating the Attribution Percentages share the same unusual effective dates as the new provisions for permanent establishments. The new formula for corporations that are not subject to the special rules (section 23 of the New Attribution Regulations) and the new formula for banks (section 25 of the New Attribution Regulations) apply to reporting periods that end on or after July 1, 2010. However, the new formula for insurers (section 24 of the New Attribution Regulations) and the new formula for trust and loan corporations, trust corporations and loan corporations (section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations) apply to reporting periods that begin on or after July 1, 2010.

[111] As noted previously, the reporting period at issue began on April 1, 2010 and ended on March 31, 2011. As a result, the new formula for corporations contained in section 23 of the New Attribution Regulations applied during the reporting period, but the new formula for loan corporations contained in section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations did not apply.

[112] The parties agree that, if the Court finds that the Appellant is a “loan corporation” for the purposes of section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations, its Attribution Percentage for the reporting period ending on March 31, 2011 is determined under that section, and was $2,537,716.99.[28]

[113] The parties also agree that, if the Court finds that the Appellant is not a “loan corporation” for the purposes of section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations, then its Attribution Percentage is calculated under the general rule for corporations. In such a situation, its Attribution Percentage for the reporting period ending on March 31, 2011 is determined under subsection 23(2) of the New Attribution Regulations and is $2,022,265.99.[29]

[114] Section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations reads as follows:

(1) Determination of the percentage - if a selected listed financial institution is a trust and loan corporation, a trust corporation or a loan corporation, the financial institution's percentage for a particular period for a participating province in which the financial institution has a permanent establishment is, despite subsection 8(2), the percentage that the gross revenue for the particular period of its permanent establishments in the participating province is of the total gross revenue for the particular period of its permanent establishments in Canada.

(2) Determination of gross revenue — In subsection (1), “gross revenue for the particular period of its permanent establishments in the participating province” means, in relation to a financial institution, the total of the gross revenue of the financial institution for the particular period arising from

(a) loans secured by lands situated in the participating province;

(b) loans, not secured by land, made to persons residing in the participating province;

(c) loans, other than loans secured by land situated in a province or country other than Canada in which the financial institution has a permanent establishment,

(i) made to persons residing in a province or country other than Canada in which the financial institution does not have a permanent establishment; and

(ii) administered by a permanent establishment in the participating province; and

(d) business conducted at its permanent establishments in the participating province, other than business that gives rise to revenue in respect of loans.

[115] Subsection 23(2) of the New Attribution Regulations reads as follows:

(2) Determination of percentage — Subject to this Part, if, in a particular period, a selected listed financial institution that is a corporation has a permanent establishment in a participating province, the financial institution's percentage for that province and for the particular period is

(a) except where paragraph (b) or (c) applies, 1/2 of the total of

(i) the percentage that its gross revenue for the particular period reasonably attributable to its permanent establishments in that province is of its total gross revenue for the particular period, and

(ii) the percentage that the total of all salaries and wages paid by the financial institution in the particular period to employees of its permanent establishments in that province is of the total of all salaries and wages paid by the financial institution in the particular period to employees of its permanent establishments in Canada;

(b) if its total gross revenue for the particular period is nil, the percentage that the total of all salaries and wages paid by the financial institution in the particular period to employees of its permanent establishments in the participating province is of the total of all salaries and wages paid by the financial institution in the particular period to employees of its permanent establishments in Canada; and

(c) if the total of all salaries and wages paid in the particular period by the financial institution to employees of its permanent establishments in Canada is nil, the percentage that its gross revenue for the particular period reasonably attributable to its permanent establishments in that province is of its total gross revenue for the particular period.

[116] The Appellant summarizes its argument in its written submissions as follows:

Based on a unified textual, contextual and purposive approach, the Appellant submits that the appropriate interpretation of “loan corporation” is a regulated entity that makes loans funded by deposits from the public. This is consistent with the established legal meaning across various federal and provincial statutes, and is supported by the context and purpose of the SLFI Regulations.[30]

[117] The Appellant places significant weight on the fact that the provincial legislation that regulates trust and loan corporations defines a “loan corporation” as being a corporation that is incorporated for the purpose of borrowing money from the public and then lending or investing such money.[31]

[118] The Respondent argues that the term “loan corporation” as used in the Attribution Regulations bears its ordinary meaning, which is a corporation whose principal business is making loans. The term loan corporation is not limited to entities incorporated and regulated under the federal Trust and Loan Companies Act or a provincial equivalent statute.

[119] The general rule for interpreting statutes is the textual, contextual and purposive approach as confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada.[32] The Supreme Court explained this rule as follows:

. . . The interpretation of a statutory provision must be made according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words play [sic] a dominant role in the interpretive process. On the other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role. The relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases the court must seek to read the provisions of an Act as a harmonious whole.[33]

[120] A literal interpretation of the words loan corporation is that they mean a corporation that makes loans. Nothing in the text suggests that the corporation must be regulated nor is there any reference to the extent to which it must make loans.

[121] In my view, a contextual and purposive analysis of section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations leads to the conclusion that the words “loan corporation” as used in the Attribution Regulations, including section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations, mean a corporation whose principal business is the making of loans. Further, in my view, a contextual and purposive analysis of section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations leads to the same conclusion.

[122] The Attribution Regulations derive their purpose from the overall purpose of the SAM Rules.

[123] As discussed previously, the purpose of the SAM Rules is to determine, in a way that does not discourage the SLFI from purchasing the goods and services in the participating province, the amount of non-refundable tax an SLFI should pay at the relevant Schedule VIII provincial tax rate on goods and services consumed or used in exempt activities in a participating province. The subsection 225.2(2) formula, particularly the Attribution Percentage, is the key component of the SAM Rules that is used to accomplish this goal.

[124] The subsection 225.2(2) formula and the Attribution Regulations, which determine the Attribution Percentage, only apply to the determination of the net tax for a particular reporting period of an SLFI.

[125] As a result, the statutory definition of SLFI is relevant when determining the context in which the words “loan corporation” are used in the Attribution Regulations.

[126] As discussed previously, an SLFI is defined to mean the listed financial institutions described in subparagraphs (i) to (x) of paragraph 149(1)(a). The relevant paragraphs for the purposes of subsection 11(1) of the Old Attribution Regulations are subparagraphs (ii) and (viii).[34]

[127] Pursuant to old and new subsection 225.2(1) and subparagraph 149(1)(a)(viii), a financial institution is an SLFI if the financial institution is “a person whose principal business is the lending of money or the purchasing of debt securities or a combination thereof”. In other words, a financial institution that is in the business of lending money is only an SLFI if its principal business is the lending of money, the purchasing of existing debt instruments, such as loans, or a combination of these two activities.

[128] The Appellant argues first that the presumption of consistent expression supports the view that a financial institution contemplated under subparagraph 149(1)(a)(viii) is “something distinct from a ‘loan corporation’. Had Parliament intended that ‘loan corporation’ be interpreted as a person whose principal business is lending money, it would have used the term ‘loan corporation’ in subparagraph 149(1)(a)(viii) or would have referred to a corporation whose ‘principal business is the lending of money’ in the SLFI Regulations [the Attribution Regulations].”[35]

[129] I do not agree with the Appellant’s argument on this point. The Appellant is suggesting that, under the Attribution Regulations, there are two groups of financial institutions whose principal business is the lending of money.

[130] One group receives deposits from the public and, as a result, is a loan corporation. This group would determine its Attribution Percentage under the special rules in section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations. The second group does not receive deposits from the public and, even though their principal business is the lending of money, they are not “loan corporations”. This group would determine its Attribution Percentage under section 23 of the New Attribution Regulations.[36]

[131] A contextual reading of the Attribution Regulations does not support such a conclusion. As I stated in Club Intrawest v. The Queen,[37]

. . . it is a general rule of statutory interpretation that legislation is deemed to be well drafted and to express completely what the legislature wanted to say. As a result, when interpreting a particular section, the Court should not add words to the section. The Supreme Court of Canada explained this principle in R v McIntosh,[38] as follows:

Second, the contextual approach allows the courts to depart from the common grammatical meaning of words where this is required by a particular context, but it does not generally mandate the courts to read words into a statutory provision. It is only when words are "reasonably capable of bearing" a particular meaning that they may be interpreted contextually. I would agree with Pierre-André Côté's observation in his book The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 231, that:

Since the judge's task is to interpret the statute, not to create it, as a general rule, interpretation should not add to the terms of the law. Legislation is deemed to be well drafted, and to express completely what the legislator wanted to say. . .

The Crown is asking this Court to read words into s. 34(2) which are simply not there. In my view, to do so would be tantamount to amending s. 34(2), which is a legislative and not a judicial function. The contextual approach provides no basis for the courts to engage in legislative amendment.

[132] There are no provisions in the GST Act that state that a listed financial institution whose principal business is the lending of money is only a “loan corporation” for the purposes of the Attribution Regulations if it accepts deposits from the public. In my view, if Parliament had intended such a result it would have added that specific condition to the legislation. It is not the Court’s role to create statutory conditions. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in McIntosh, this is a legislative not a judicial function.

[133] Further, as I will discuss, the structure of Part II of the Attribution Regulations leads to the conclusion that the Attribution Regulations group together certain listed financial institutions together on the basis of the nature of the business they carried on during a relevant period. Those regulations group under one section, i.e., section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations, which replaces section 11, SLFIs whose principal business is the lending of money.

[134] Second, the Appellant is arguing that the legislation places corporations whose principal business is the lending of money in two groups depending upon whether or not the corporations are regulated under federal or provincial legislation. In the Appellant’s view only a regulated company is a “loan corporation”. The regulatory legislation contains the requirement that loan corporations receive deposits.

[135] There are no provisions in the SAM Rules or the other provisions of the GST Act that define a loan corporation as being a regulated company under federal or provincial legislation. In fact, in a situation where Parliament wanted to restrict a specific type of SLFI to a regulated entity, it could do so through the provisions of subparagraphs 149(1)(a)(i) to (x) which define a listed financial institution.

[136] One example is subparagraph 149(1)(a)(ii), which is the paragraph that, in effect, includes trust corporations in the definition of SLFI.

[137] Subparagraph (ii) refers to “a corporation that is licensed or otherwise authorized under the laws of Canada or a province to carry on in Canada the business of offering to the public its services as a trustee”. In other words, a financial institution that carries on the business of providing trustee services is only an SLFI if it is regulated under either federal or provincial legislation. Therefore, the words trust corporation in subsection 11(1) of the Old Attribution Regulations only refer to a corporation that is licensed or otherwise authorized under federal or provincial legislation to carry on a trustee business.

[138] This is in contrast with subparagraph 149(1)(a)(viii), which does not require the corporation whose principal business is the lending of money or the purchase of existing debt instruments to be regulated in order for it to be a listed financial institution and an SLFI.

[139] I will now turn to the specific context in which the words “loan corporation” are used, namely the Attribution Regulations that calculate the Attribution Percentage for the purposes of the subsection 225.2(2) formula.

[140] As discussed previously, the subsection 225.2(2) formula begins by calculating the amount of non-refundable tax the SLFI has paid at the 5% GST rate on all of it purchases and importations of goods and services (i.e., the Non-recoverable 5% Tax). This represents the extent to which the 5% GST was paid on goods and services consumed in exempt activities in all provinces where the SLFI carries on business.

[141] For example, the Appellant carries on business in all provinces. The figure resulting from the A – B calculation, that is the Non-recoverable 5% Tax amount, represents the portion of the total tax the Appellant paid at the 5% GST rate that relates to goods and services consumed in all of the exempt activities carried on by the Appellant.

[142] The formula then applies the Attribution Percentage to allocate a portion of this Non-recoverable 5% Tax to a specific participating province. As discussed previously, the Attribution Percentage is calculated under various sections in Part 2 of the Attribution Regulations.

[143] These sections contain criteria that are intended to be a reasonable proxy for the SLFI’s consumption or use of goods and services in its exempt activities in a specific participating province. The criteria for a specific SLFI are based on the nature of the business carried on by the SLFI.

[144] As was noted in the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement issued by the Department of Finance at the time the Old Attribution Regulations were introduced: “These Regulations ensure that certain financial institutions that operate in an HST participating province account for the appropriate amount of the provincial component of the HST attributable to that province. The rules for determining the attribution percentage assist in this process by providing an objective basis on which to establish the extent of an SLFI’s business within and outside the participating provinces . . .”[39] [emphasis added].

[145] The Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement accompanying the New Attribution Regulations states the following:

. . . These amendments generally provide that . . . the methods for determining an SLFI’s provincial attribution percentages, which the SLFI uses to determine its liability for the provincial component of the HST for each of the HST participating provinces, reflect the consumption of the SLFI’s financial services by residents of the province.[40]

[Emphasis added.]

[146] During the relevant period, SLFIs that were not subject to the special rules used the general rule in section 23 of the New Attribution Regulations to calculate their Attribution Percentages. This section estimates consumption in a participating province on the basis of gross revenue generated from the business carried on in the specific province and salary and wages paid to employees who work in the business in the province.[41]

[147] The Attribution Regulations recognize that the criteria in the general rule do not provide a reasonable consumption proxy for all types of SLFIs. As a result, sections 9 to 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and sections 24 to 38 of the New Attribution Regulations provide different criteria for various types of SLFIs.

[148] The special rules in sections 9 to 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and sections 24 to 38 of the New Attribution Regulations look at the unique nature of the business carried on by the relevant entity. As discussed previously, the formula for insurance companies, contained in section 9 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 24 of the New Attribution Regulations, is based upon premium revenue generated from certain insurance business in the specific province. The formula for banks, contained in section 10 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 25 of the New Attribution Regulations, is based primarily on the amount of loans and deposits generated by the business in the specific participating province, but also considers salary and wages paid to employees who work in the business in the province. The formula for trust and loan corporations, loan corporations and trust corporations, contained in section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations, is based upon gross revenue from certain loans made in the course of the business carried on in the specific participating province.

[149] The drafters of the regulations clearly felt that the criteria used in the general rule in section 8 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 23 of the New Attribution Regulations did not, for certain entities, provide a reasonable proxy for consumption. They determined that these entities required special criteria.

[150] It is clear from the wording of the relevant sections of Part 2 of the Attribution Regulations that the criteria chosen reflect the unique nature of the business carried on by the entity. For insurance companies it was felt that revenue from premiums was a better indication of consumption than a combination of total gross revenue and salary and wages. For banks it was felt that the location of deposits and loans, rather than the source of the bank’s revenue, was the best indication of consumption, provided an adjustment was made for salary and wages.

[151] For the entities covered by section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations, which include “loan corporations”, the decision was made that the proxy for consumption in a participating province should not be based on gross revenue and salary and wages. Rather it should be based primarily on the revenue from certain loans. The loans chosen were those that had a direct connection with the province: loans secured by land in the participating province; loans, not secured by land, made to residents of the province; and certain loans administered by the entity`s employees in the province.

[152] Clearly, section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations (and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations) is attempting to estimate consumption for entities whose principal business is the lending of money.

[153] In my view, the foregoing textual, contextual and purposive analysis, particularly the examination of the definition of SLFI in paragraphs 149(1)(a)(i) to (x), of the wording of section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and of the structure of Part II of the Attribution Regulations, leads to the conclusion that the words “loan corporation” as used in section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations (and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations) refer to a corporation whose principal business is the lending of money.

[154] An entity such as the Appellant is only included in the SAM Rules because its principal business is the lending of money. Further, the Attribution Regulations provide special rules for determining the consumption of such an entity in a participating province. The calculation of consumption under section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations is based primarily on revenue from the making of loans. In my view, on a contextual analysis of Part II of the Attribution Regulations, these sections are intended to apply to financial institutions that are deemed to be SLFIs because their principal business is the lending of money. This result will only arise if the words “loan corporation” as used in section 11 of the Old Attribution Regulations and section 26 of the New Attribution Regulations are interpreted to mean any financial institution whose principal business is the lending of money.

[155] My conclusion is consistent with the purpose of the Attribution Percentage, which is to provide a proxy for consumption in a specific participating province.

[156] Although the new definition of permanent establishment in section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations does not apply to the reporting period in front of me, it does apply to future reporting periods of the Appellant. The new definition represents a fundamental change in the application of the SAM Rules. The old definition was based solely on the location of a fixed place of business. The new definition looks past any fixed places of business and sees where the SLFI is actually carrying on its business.

[157] This change was made in recognition of the growth of e-commerce. The Department of Finance backgrounder issued on May 19, 2010 with the draft of the New Attribution Regulations explains, as follows, the reason for the change as it applies to banks:

The current fixed place of business requirement in the SLFI test for banks generates inappropriate tax results where a bank has customers across Canada, but is not an SLFI under the existing rules because it does not have fixed places of business both in any of the participating provinces and in any of the non-participating provinces. This case could arise, for example, where a bank has a fixed place of business in only one province but provides loan and deposit-related financial services to customers in all provinces using internet and telephone banking portals. In such a case, the appropriate GST/HST result is that the bank be subject to SLFI rules and be required to calculate PVAT in respect of each participating province where its customers reside.[42]

[Emphasis added.]

[158] The comment with respect to the provision of loans applies equally to a corporation whose principal business is the lending of money.

[159] Regardless of whether an SLFI is subject to the general rule under section 8 of the Old Attribution Regulations or one of the special rules in sections 9, 10 and 11, if the SLFI does not have a permanent establishment in a specific participating province, then its Attribution Percentage for the province is nil.

[160] If an entity such as the appellant, whose principal business is the lending of money, is not a “loan corporation” then it will only be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a participating province in which it has a fixed place of business. As a result, it will not be required to calculate an adjustment to its net tax under subsection 225.2(2) for any participating province where it does not have a fixed place of business, even if it makes loans to residents of the province.

[161] However, if such an entity is a “loan corporation” then, as a result of the application of section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations, it will be required to calculate an adjustment under subsection 225.2(2) for any participating province where the financial institution has outstanding loans secured by land located in the province or, if not secured by land, made to residents of the province, even if it does not have a fixed place of business in the province.

[162] In my view, section 3 of the New Attribution Regulations provides additional contextual support for my conclusion that a “loan corporation”, as that term is used in the Attribution Regulations, means a corporation whose principal business is the making of loans.

[163] The Appellant admitted in the SAF that its principal business is the lending of money. As a result, it was a loan corporation during the relevant period for the purposes of the SAM Rules.

[164] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.

Signed at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 24th day of February 2017.
