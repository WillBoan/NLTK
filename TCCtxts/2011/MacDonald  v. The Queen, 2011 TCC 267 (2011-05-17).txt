Respondent.

REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, Taxing Officer, T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on May 12, 2011. It follows a Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Woods dated February 23, 2010, wherein appeals from assessments made under the Income Tax Act for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 taxation years were dismissed, with costs. The Appellant did not participate in this taxation of costs. Mr. David I. Besler represented the Respondent.

[2] The Notice of Appointment for this taxation of costs was issued on April 18, 2011 and served on the Appellant by registered mail. A search of Canada Post’s records disclosed that the Notice of Appointment was successfully delivered to the Appellant’s address on April 26, 2011. At the time appointed for this taxation, Mr. MacDonald was not available. In accordance with Rule 13 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), the hearing was adjourned. A further attempt to contact the Appellant was made thirty minutes later, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the taxation proceeded without the participation of the Appellant.

[3] The Respondent’s Bill of Costs was amended to include a claim for $350.00 for this taxation of costs under Tariff Item 1(1)(c) and to delete the claims for $350.00 for preparation for hearing under Tariff Item 1(1)(g) and $1,000.00 for conduct of the hearing under Tariff Item 1(1)(h).

[4] With the deletion of the two amounts noted above and the addition of $350.00 on account of this taxation of costs, the total amount claimed for counsel fees has been reduced to $2,825.00. From this amount, I will tax off the sum of $350.00 representing the counsel fee claimed for responding to a motion filed by the Appellant. The Honourable Justice Jorré’s Order dated September 14, 2009 awarded costs to the Respondent in the amount of $1,000.00. As the Court has already made an award of costs for that step in the proceeding, the Respondent is not entitled to recover an additional amount on a taxation of costs. The total amount allowed for counsel fees is $2,475.00.

[5] The Bill of Costs included the $1,000.00 costs awarded to the Respondent in the Order of the Honourable Justice Jorré dated September 14, 2009, which amount Mr. Besler confirmed remained unpaid. This amount will be included in the Certificate of Costs.

[6] The disbursements claimed in the amount of $189.48 were supported by receipts. I am satisfied that the disbursements were essential for the conduct of the proceeding and the full amount claimed is allowed.

[7] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and the amount of $3,664.48 is allowed.

Signed at Toronto, Ontario, this 17th day of May 2011.
