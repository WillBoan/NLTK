ii) were personal or living expenses of the Appellant; and/or

iii) were not reasonable under the circumstances.

[3] In imposing penalties for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years, the Minister relied on the following additional facts set out in paragraph 10 of the Amended Reply to the Notice of Appeal:

(a) in preparing his returns of income filed for each of the years under appeal, the Appellant failed to include in income all of the gross revenues he received in those years; (denied)

(b) in preparing his returns of income filed for each of the years under appeal, the Appellant intentionally and knowingly claimed business deductions for personal expenses and overstated business expenses actually incurred in those years; (denied)

(c) by failing to include in income all of the revenues received and by overstating legitimate business expenses, the Appellant underreported his net business income in the years under appeal by material amounts; (denied)

(d) the amounts of net business income that the Appellant failed to include in his income for the years under appeal were material both in amount and in relation to reported income; (denied)

(e) the Appellant was aware, or should have been aware, that all of the income he received in the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years was not reported; (denied)

(f) the Appellant was aware, or should have been aware, that all of the expenses he claimed as deductions from business income were not incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business; and (denied)

(g) the Appellant owed an amount of tax when he filed his 2002 return on October 20, 2003. (denied)

[4] The Minister also referred to other material facts set out in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Amended Reply to the Notice of Appeal:

11. The Minister had intended to allow the Appellant to deduct additional business expenses in the amounts of $2,865 and $3,328 in respect of parts for auto repairs in the 2001 and 2002 taxation years, respectively. Due to a calculation error, those amounts were not included in total expenses allowed. (admitted only in part)

12. The Appellant was allowed excessive rent expenses for the 2003 taxation year as a deduction against his paralegal services business income. The amount of $24,443 was rent paid in respect of the property from which, in the 2003 taxation year, the Appellant provided his professional services and his son operated an auto repair business. The full amount of the expense was not incurred by the Appellant for the purposes of gaining or producing income from the paralegal services business. (denied)

[5] The Appellant testified at the hearing and filed the following documents:

(a) a summary of payments made by Khan Auto Repairs in 2001 showing the T4A slips issued to:

i) Nazil Ally: $10,155

ii) Surdev Virk 8,640

iii) Sharimala Singh 3,000

Sub-total: $21,795

and the payments made by cheques to:

iv) Harnan Kular $13,376

v) Terry Singh 8,950

vi) Nazil Ally 3,500

vii) Zakir Musafir 3,200

Sub-total: $29,026

Total: $50,821.

(b) his income tax return for 2001

(c) his income tax return for 2002

(d) his income tax return for 2003

(e) a letter from the Canada Revenue Agency dated March 31, 2005 showing the proposed adjustments to his income tax returns for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years

(f) a notice of objection dated June 14, 2005 filed with the registry of Finance of the Province of Ontario

(g) a copy of the T4A slips issued by Khan Auto Repairs in respect of the 2001 taxation year

(h) a copy of the cheques made by Khan Auto Repairs in 2001 to subcontractors

(i) a statement of expenses made by Khan Auto Repairs in 2001

(j) a summary of the payments made in 2001 by Khan Auto Repairs for labour costs showing the payments made by cash and by cheques.

[6] The Appellant explained that his income tax returns for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years were signed by him but were prepared by a professional tax preparer, Mr. Barrat, based upon the information that he provided, such as the statement of expenses made by Khan Auto Repairs in 2001 referred to in paragraph 5(i).

[7] The Appellant pointed out the fact that all relevant documents including the bank statements and the cheques to the subcontractors, have been submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”) in the course of the audit conducted in 2005 and that they have been returned to him. He also explained that he had to retain the services of subcontractors to work in his auto repairs business because he was not able to work as a result of a motor vehicle accident in January 2000 and hip surgery in June 2001.

[8] The CRA’s tax auditor, Asiya Azim, testified at the hearing. She explained that the books and records of the Appellant were inadequate and incomplete. She received the Appellant’s invoices and receipts listed in Forms T2213 filed as Exhibits R-2 and R-3:

2001

- income invoices;

- Kahn Auto Repairs receipts from February 2001 to December 2001;

- bank statements

- income tax statements

2002

- invoices and bills

2003

- bank statements and cancelled cheques

- work orders.

All documents were returned to the Appellant on April 21, 2005 after the completion of the audit.

[9] With the information contained in the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph, she prepared a schedule for each type of expenses claimed by the Appellant in respect of each business. She requested more information from the Appellant without any success. After several calls and two or three unsuccessful attempts to schedule a meeting with the Appellant, she prepared and sent the March 31, 2005 letter proposing the adjustments to the Appellant’s income tax returns. No representations were made by the Appellant as a result of the proposed adjustments.

[10] In the course of her testimony, she made the following observations:

(a) she has conducted both the income tax audit and the goods and services tax audit;

(b) she allowed the deduction of the amounts for which there were T4As and had rejected the cheques to the subcontractors because there was no evidence they were effectively cashed or deposited and that they were not made for personal expenses. She had not made a reconciliation of the cheques with the bank statements. No T4As and no cheques to subcontractors for 2002 were submitted;

(c) she has not seen the statement of expenses made by Khan Auto Repairs in 2001, nor a similar statement of expenses in 2002;

(d) she has not seen the summary of the payments made in 2001 by Khan Auto Repairs for labour costs nor a similar summary for 2002.

Analysis

[11] The evidence reveals that the Appellant ceased to operate the auto repairs business in 2002 and that the Appellant’s son began to operate an auto repair business in the same location where the Appellant had operated his auto repair business. The Appellant’s son worked in the auto repairs business of his father during the 2001 and 2002 taxation years but he was not paid for his services as he was then an apprentice. The Appellant’s son nevertheless signed the cheques in 2001 to the subcontractors. No T4As and no cheques to subcontractors were submitted for 2002 and no witnesses testified at the hearing to confirm that they worked for Khan Auto Repairs during the 2001 and 2002 taxation years and that they were effectively paid for their services. Finally, there were some discrepancies between the amounts on the T4As and the total of amounts shown in the summary for labour costs paid in 2001. For example, in the case of Nazil Ally, his T4A for 2001 shows self-employed commissions of $10,155 while the summary shows that he has received a total remuneration of $11,900 in cash and by cheques. In the case of Sharimala Singh, the T4A for 2001 shows self-employed commissions of $3,000 while the summary shows that she has received commissions of $7,665 in cash and $7,950 by cheques respectively.

[12] In light of the foregoing, the summary of payments made in 2001 by Kahn Auto Repairs for labour costs is not reliable nor corroborated by other evidence. No reasonable or plausible explanations were given by the Appellant as to why certain subcontractors were paid in cash only or by cheques only or by a combination of cash and cheques and why T4As were issued only to three subcontractors and not to all of them.

[13] Concerning the calculation of the unreported revenue for the auto repairs business and the paralegal services business for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years, no viva voce or documentary evidence has been submitted by the Appellant to destroy the assumption of facts relied on by the Minister. Clearly, the Appellant has not met his burden of proof. The Appellant has been assessed in accordance with the information that he provided in the course of the audit.

[14] The Appellant understated his gross business and professional income for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years by the amounts of $1,877 ($1,500 reduction from the auto repairs business and $3,377 increase from the paralegal services business), $34,204 ($30,550 from the auto repairs business and $3,654 from the paralegal services business) and $2,322 (from the paralegal services business) respectively.

[15] The Minister applied a late filing penalty pursuant to subsection 162(1) of the Act for the 2002 taxation year and penalties pursuant to section 163(2) of the Act for underreporting business and professional income for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years.

[16] Subsection 162(1) of the Act imposes a penalty where a taxpayer fails to file a return as and when required by subsection 150(1) of the Act where tax is payable in respect of the relevant taxation year. Subsection 162(1) reads as follows:

Failure to file return of income

162. (1) Every person who fails to file a return of income for a taxation year as and when required by subsection 150(1) is liable to a penalty equal to the total of

(a) an amount equal to 5% of the person’s tax payable under this Part for the year that was unpaid when the return was required to be filed, and

(b) the product obtained when 1% of the person’s tax payable under this Part for the year that was unpaid when the return was required to be filed is multiplied by the number of complete months, not exceeding 12, from the date on which the return was required to be filed to the date on which the return was filed.

[17] In this instance, the Appellant filed his income tax return for 2002 on October 20, 2003 and it was received by the Sudbury taxation office on November 6, 2003. As a result of the audit, the Appellant is liable to pay an amount of federal tax in respect of the 2002 taxation year. The subsection 162(1) penalty has been properly applied for 2002.

[18] Subsection 163(2) of the Act imposes a penalty where a taxpayer knowingly, or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence, participates in or makes a false statement for the purposes of the Act. The relevant part of subsection 163(2) reads as follows:

False statements or omissions

(2) Every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a return, form, certificate, statement or answer (in this section referred to as a “return”) filed or made in respect of a taxation year for the purposes of this Act, is liable to a penalty of the greater of $100 and 50% of the total of

[19] In this instance, it has been established that the Appellant made or participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of false statements or omissions in filing his income tax returns for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years, as a result of which the tax that would have been payable, if assessed by the information provided in the Appellant’s income tax returns filed for those years, was less than the tax in fact payable. In so doing, the Appellant acted, knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, in carrying out a duty or obligation imposed under the Act. In the circumstances, the penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act were properly applied for those years.

[20] For those reasons, the appeals from the reassessments made under the Income Tax Act in respect of the 2001 and 2002 taxation years are allowed and the reassessments are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessments on the basis that the Appellant is entitled to additional business expenses in the amounts of $2,865 and $3,328 in respect of parts for auto repairs in the 2001 and 2002 taxation years, respectively and the penalties shall be adjusted accordingly. The appeal from the reassessment made under the Income Tax Act in respect of the 2003 taxation year is dismissed.
