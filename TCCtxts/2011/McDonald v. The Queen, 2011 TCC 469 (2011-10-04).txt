REASONS FOR ORDER

V.A. Miller J.

[1] The Appellants have made an application pursuant to subsection 147(7) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) for directions to be given to the taxing officer concerning costs.

[2] In the Judgment dated September 20, 2011, I directed that the Appellants were entitled to one set of costs. Counsel for the Appellants has questioned whether the costs should be allowed for a Class A proceeding or a Class B proceeding.

[3] It is the Appellants’ position that the costs awarded should be for a Class B proceeding as the aggregate of the amounts at issue in the appeals is greater than $50,000 which is the limit for a Class A proceeding.

[4] I disagree with counsel for the Appellants. When appeals are heard on common evidence, the amounts at issue are not aggregated to determine the class of the appeals: Centre hospitalier Le Gardeur v. The Queen, [2008] G.S.T.C. 154 (TCC).

[5] Each of the appeals has been classified as a Class A proceeding as the amount in issue in each of the appeals was less than $50,000. The costs awarded to the Appellants are to be calculated according to the Class A.

[6] The Appellants are entitled to one set of costs which is to be calculated on the basis of a Class A proceeding.
