HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR TAXATION

[1] This taxation came on for hearing on Wednesday, February 15, 2012, by way of telephone conference call. Two unsuccessful attempts to contact counsel for the Appellant were made. The taxation of costs proceeded thirty minutes after the appointed time, without the participation of counsel for the Appellant. Mr. Gregory Perlinski represented the Respondent.

[2] Two Bill of Costs were filed by the Respondent. The first Bill of Costs in the amount of $2,078.50 followed the Court’s Order dated February 22, 2008. The second Bill of Costs in the amount of $8,612.87 followed the Judgment of the Honourable Justice Jorré dated January 23, 2011.

[3] The amounts claimed for counsel fees on the two Bills of Costs were in accordance with the Tariff. The disbursements claimed were supported by receipts and I am satisfied that they were essential for the conduct of the appeal. I will allow the full amount claimed for counsel fees and disbursements on each Bill of Costs.

[4] The Bills of Costs of the Respondent are taxed and $10,691.37 is allowed.

Signed at Toronto, Canada, this 27th day of February 2012.
