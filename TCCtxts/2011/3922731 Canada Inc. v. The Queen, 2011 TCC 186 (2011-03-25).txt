REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Rip C.J.

[1] This is an appeal from reassessments issued under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Act) for the period from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2007, in which the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) assessed the goods and services tax (GST) collected but not remitted by the appellant for an amount of $10,357.17 and denied input tax credits (ITCs) in the amount of $7,378.85.

[2] The appellant is known under the business name “Handyman Plus.” The appellant provides residential renovation services that are subject to GST. The appellant is registered for GST purposes.

[3] During the period at issue, the appellant’s sales were $561,245.31 and it collected the GST for an amount of $33,608.32. However, the Minister submits that only one amount of $23,251.15 was remitted. The appellant therefore failed to remit $10,357.17.

[4] During the same period, the appellant claimed ITCs in the amount of $17,839.82. The Minister alleges that no documentation required to support the ITC claim for $7,378.85 was provided.

[5] Prior to and at the beginning of the hearing, the parties agreed to reduce the amounts in issue. The only amounts still being disputed by the appellant are as follows: the unpaid and disallowed GST amount now totals $1,268.42 for the period ending March 31, 2006, whereas the ITC amount claimed by the appellant, for the period ending September 30, 2007, is $5,775.79 and concerns only one invoice.

[6] Serge Lafortune testified for the appellant. He has been handling his accounting for four years. His job involves the preparation of yearly financial statements, bookkeeping and tax remittances. He handled his accounting for the period ending September 30, 2007, but not the period ending March 31, 2006.

[7] As for the $5,775.79 in disallowed ITCs, the appellant introduced in evidence an invoice from the corporation 4362799 Canada Inc. dated August 13, 2007. The invoice was for “consulting services” charged to the appellant in the amount of $102,011.00 $ (including $6,120.66 in GST) for a total of $108,131.66. The accountant claimed ITCs for that invoice in the amount of $6,120.66. At the time of audit, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) refused to allow the ITCs considering that there was no mention of the GST number of 4362799 on the invoice. Furthermore, 4362799 was not registered for GST purposes and had not remitted the amount in question. 432799 was registered by the CRA at the time of the audit.

[8] The CRA’s audit allowed the accountant to realize that the invoice of 432799 was inaccurate. In fact, the appellant only paid $102,011 to 432799 by way of a cheque in the amount of $45,000 and by a certified cheque in the amount of $57,011. The accountant inferred that it was rather a “tax inclusive” transaction totalling $102,011. The invoice is therefore incorrect and the tax actually charged is $5,775.79 and not $6,120.66.

[9] There is also another anomaly. The invoice is dated August 13, 2007, whereas the first cheque of $45,000 is dated July 19, 2007. However, nowhere on the invoice is there mention of the first payment of $45,000 already made. The accountant never amended the GST report respecting the incorrect ITC amount that was initially claimed as he was unaware of the error until the time of the audit.

[10] The contract between the appellant and 432799 was not filed in evidence. There was no communication between the appellant and 432799, or with its directors, to amend the invoice and it seems that 432799 is being dissolved. The accountant stated that he had a discussion with the principal of the appellant during which he confirmed that the agreement was for $102,011.

[11] As for the GST amount collected but not remitted, the books and records of the appellant indicate for the period ending March 31, 2006, that the GST owed is $3,262.42 whereas only $1,924 has been remitted according to its GST return. That leaves a shortfall of $1,338.42 that has not been remitted to the CRA. The parties have agreed to reduce that amount to $1,268.42.

[12] According to the accountant, there is no supporting documentation, no service sold to a customer that generated GST for an amount of $1,268.42. Although the accountant did not go through all of the appellant’s invoices, he did verify subsequent cash inflows. He began his cash inflow verifications only from April 1, 2006. He did not verify the appellant’s invoices and cash inflows prior to that date.

[13] While the accountant does not know why such an amount appeared on the appellant’s return, he put forward certain hypotheses. He also stated that he attempted to contact the former accountant, but to no avail. He could not recall his name at the hearing.

[14] The following exchange properly summarizes the situation as regards the amount of $1,268.42. Counsel for the respondent posed the following question [Translation]: “So you are suggesting that the amount is incorrect but without providing any concrete evidence as to why the amount is incorrect. The different [sic] theory but it is unknown what actually happened with the books and records for the year 2006?” The accountant replied, “That is correct.”

[15] As for the ITCs, the appellant is of the view that it is entitled to them as the tax was in fact paid. It is irrelevant whether or not 432799 was registered as it had an obligation to be registered. Moreover, the appellant cannot be held liable for the failure of 432799 to remit the GST; it is entitled to ITCs from the moment GST is paid. Finally, the obligation to provide an invoice with a GST number is simply a “technicality” of the Act, which, furthermore, was subsequently resolved when the CRA assigned a GST number to 432799.

[16] The respondent, for her part, is of the view that the appellant is not entitled to the ITCs, as the invoice does not follow the formal procedure set out in paragraph 169(4)(a) of the Act and in the regulatory provisions. The case law strictly applied such provisions in Systematix,[1] Baker,[2] Camion DM Inc[3] and St-Isidore Écono Centre Inc.[4]

[17] As for the unremitted GST amount of $1,268.42, the appellant argues that good faith is always presumed and, from the moment it stated that the amount was incorrectly entered, in light of after-the fact verifications, the CRA should have no longer claimed that amount from it. As for the respondent, she is asking that the Court draw a negative inference from the absence of testimony by the former accountant and principal of the appellant.

[19] I have substantial doubts regarding the invoice involving the amount of $5,775.79. The invoice has a number of anomalies. The GST amount indicated is inaccurate and does not make mention of the initial payment of $45,000. Moreover, the contract for services between 432799 and the appellant was not filed in Court and no principal of the appellant testified. The accountant’s testimony as to the nature of the agreement between 432799 and the appellant is hearsay. All this leads me to believe that the tax was never paid or charged. However, even without arriving at that conclusion, the appellant cannot claim ITCs, as the formal procedure set out in paragraphs 3(c) and 3(b)(i) of the Regulations was not followed. The invoice must bear the supplier’s registration number.

[20] The “technicalities” of the Act, as characterized by counsel for the appellant, must be respected. The case law is well-established. The following excerpt from the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision[5] properly summarizes the situation:

[4] We are of the view that the legislation is mandatory in that it requires persons who have paid GST to suppliers to have valid GST registration numbers from those suppliers when claiming input tax credits.

[5] We agree with the comments of Bowie J. in the case of Key Property Management Corp. v. R. [2004] G.S.T.C. 32 (T.C.C.) where he stated:

The whole purpose of paragraph 169(4)(a) and the Regulations is to protect the consolidated revenue fund against both fraudulent and innocent incursions. They cannot succeed in that purpose unless they are considered to be mandatory requirements and strictly enforced. The result of viewing them as merely directory would not simply be inconvenient, it would be a serious breach of the integrity of the statutory scheme.

[Emphasis added.]

[6] We also agree with the comments of Campbell J. in Davis v. R. [2004] G.S.T.C. 134 (TCC):

Because of the very specific way in which these provisions are worded, I do not believe they can be sidestepped. They are clearly mandatory and the Appellant has simply not met the technical requirements which the Act and the Regulations place upon him as a member of a self-assessing system.

[Emphasis added.]

[21] The appellant cannot claim ITCs if the invoice does not bear the supplier’s registration number. Although the Minister could have allowed the ITCs under subsection 169(5) of the Act, he chose not to exercise his discretion in this case. The Court cannot force his hand. In such circumstances, it is irrelevant whether or not the invoice was “tax inclusive.”

[22] The burden of proving that the amount of $1,268.42 was incorrectly entered rested with the appellant. The new accountant did not verify all the invoices and cash inflows for the period ending March 31, 2006. He simply verified subsequent cash inflows. The accountant and the appellant should have conducted an analysis of the invoices and cash inflows for the period ending March 31, 2006. The fact of verifying cash inflows after that period is not enough. Furthermore, the accountant does not know why the amount was incorrectly entered. In such circumstances, the testimony of the former accountant was necessary.

[23] The appeal is dismissed.
