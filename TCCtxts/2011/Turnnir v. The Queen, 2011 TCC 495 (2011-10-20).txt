The Appellant’s defence at the criminal proceedings was that he was a “natural person”.

[4] According to the Reply, the Minister made the following assumptions of fact when he determined the Appellant’s income tax liability:

[5] At the hearing of this appeal, it was the Appellant’s position that he is the “authorized administrator of the legal person named” in the Reply. He stated that all of the assumptions were false because he is a “sovereign person” and as such he does not have to pay taxes unless it can be shown that there is a contract between him and the Government of Canada. It was his opinion that only government employees had to pay taxes. The Appellant made other statements which reflected his displeasure with the governments of Canada and British Columbia. He stated that he was not relying on the “natural person” argument which I note was his position in his Notice of Appeal.

[6] Subsequent to the hearing, the Appellant filed documents with the court which purported to show that there was a Security Agreement between him, “the flesh and blood living man” and the straw man / legal entity CHANDLER TURNNIR.

[7] The Appellant did not attempt to satisfy the burden of proof. Aside from stating that the assumptions were incorrect, he adduced no evidence to challenge the assumptions.

[8] The Appellant’s argument that he is a “sovereign person” and cannot be taxed unless there is a contract between him and the government is without merit. The Income Tax Act (the “Act”) does not distinguish between “person”, “natural person” and “sovereign person”. The definition of “person” in section 248 of the Act includes a “flesh and blood living man” such as the Appellant. As stated by Gauthier J. in M.N.R. v Stanchfield , 2009 FC 99 at paragraph 17:

…The whole notion of their being a second capacity distinct from the one of a natural person or human being is a pure fiction, one which is not sanctioned by law. One can describe nothing in any terms one wishes; it still remains nothing.

[9] The Appellant is a “person” who was resident in British Columbia, Canada in 1999, 2000, and 2001 and the income he received in those years is taxable.

[10] It is worth mentioning that the Appellant has argued that he is not liable for income taxes; and yet, he seeks the benefits of being a person resident in Canada. In his income tax returns he applied for the GST credit. Also, the 2000 T4 corporate summary showed that he had the maximum pensionable earnings for Canada Pension Plan purposes. At the criminal proceedings, the Appellant explained this by stating that “the taxpayer is entitled to any benefits which he is entitled to” and the “taxpayer” wanted to maximize his Canada Pension.

[11] The Minister has the burden to show that gross negligence penalties were properly assessed. According to the Federal Court in Venne v. The Queen, 84 DTC 6247, gross negligence involves a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting or indifference as to whether the law is complied with or not.

[12] The evidence has shown that prior to 1999 the Appellant reported his income and paid taxes on it. He stated that in 1999 he found out that there must be a contract between the legal person and the government in order for him to be liable for taxes. He wrote to the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) and was told that he had to report all of his income. In spite of this, the Appellant reported nil income in his income tax returns for 1999, 2000 and 2001. The Appellant was also advised by his former accountant, R. W. Burr, C.A., that he had to report the amount of $444,000 which he withdrew in 2000 from his corporation, Chandler Holdings Ltd. In a letter dated December 18, 2001 to the Appellant, Mr. Burr wrote:

I am concerned that $444,000 of wages were shown in the company records, paid to you in the prior year, that you have not reported on a personal tax return nor prepared T4 slips for (both of which I would argue are necessary).

You should be aware that you have a risk of having the wage deduction disallowed in the company because you have failed to report it personally.



In view of your opinion that you do not agree with the current assessment of personal income taxes, I am enclosing a photocopy of a recent release concerning a tax court case that went against a taxpayer with similar views. You might find this of interest and you should consider it carefully in your current stand.

[13] The Appellant’s failure to report his income was intentional and I am satisfied that the Respondent has met the onus in this appeal and the subsection 163(2) penalties were properly assessed.

[14] The late filing penalty was also properly imposed and the Appellant did not speak to the issue.

[15] The appeal is dismissed with costs.
