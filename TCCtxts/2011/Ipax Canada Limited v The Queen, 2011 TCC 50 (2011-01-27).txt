REASONS RESPECTING SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS

V.A. Miller J.

[1] In my Judgment in these appeals, I invited the parties to submit written submissions if they were unable to reach an agreement with respect to costs.

[2] The appeals were heard on common evidence on April 15, 16, July 5 and 6, 2010. The Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) used the net worth method to reassess the individual Appellants for the 1995 to 2000 taxation years inclusively. The following amounts were included in income:

Year

Garfield Crawford

Doreen Crawford

1995

$30,328

$21,229

1996

$16,119

$11,283

1997

$29,734

$20,814

1998

$32,345

$22,641

1999

$29,355

$20,549

2000

$40,495

$28,347

The Minister of National Revenue (the “Minister”) relied on subsection 152(4) of the Income Tax Act (the “Act”) to reassess Doreen Crawford and Garfield Crawford’s 1995 taxation year beyond the statutory limitation period. The Minister relied on subsection 152(7) to assess the individual Appellants’ tax liability for the 2000 taxation year. Penalties pursuant to section 162 and subsection 163(2) of the Act were assessed for each of the individual Appellants.

[3] The corporate Appellant’s GST appeal related to the reporting periods May 1, 1994 to April 30, 2001. The Minister had increased its GST collectible by the amount of $102,168.25.

[4] The appeals were allowed to reduce the assessments by amounts conceded by the Respondent and by the further amounts of $7,356, $8,628, $7,220, $6,353, $6,181, $6,244 for the 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 taxation years respectively.

[5] The Appellants seek either a partial award of costs or an Order that no costs are to be awarded.

[6] The Respondent seeks costs and presents two options for awarding those costs.

Option 1

a) Costs according to Schedule II, Tariff B (the “Tariff”);

b) A lump sum of $10,000 in enhanced costs pursuant to subsection 147(4) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the “Rules”); and

c) Costs of the written submissions fixed at $525

Option 2

a) Costs according to the Tariff, plus counsel fees for July 5 and 6, 2010; and,

b) Costs for the written submissions fixed at $525

[7] Section 147 of the Rules gives the Court a broad discretion in awarding costs but that discretion must be exercised on a principled basis[1]. Section 147 of the Rules reads:

General Principles

147. (1) The Court may determine the amount of the costs of all parties involved in any proceeding, the allocation of those costs and the persons required to pay them.

(2) Costs may be awarded to or against the Crown.

(3) In exercising its discretionary power pursuant to subsection (1) the Court may consider,

(a) the result of the proceeding,

(b) the amounts in issue,

(c) the importance of the issues,

(d) any offer of settlement made in writing,

(e) the volume of work,

(f) the complexity of the issues,

(g) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding,

(h) the denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted,

(i) whether any stage in the proceedings was,

(i) improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or

(ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution,

(j) any other matter relevant to the question of costs.

(4) The Court may fix all or part of the costs with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B and, further, it may award a lump sum in lieu of or in addition to any taxed costs.

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision in these rules, the Court has the discretionary power,

(a) to award or refuse costs in respect of a particular issue or part of a proceeding,

(b) to award a percentage of taxed costs or award taxed costs up to and for a particular stage of a proceeding, or

(c) to award all or part of the costs on a solicitor and client basis.

(6) The Court may give directions to the taxing officer and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Court in any particular proceeding may give directions,

(a) respecting increases over the amounts specified for the items in Schedule II, Tariff B,

(b) respecting services rendered or disbursements incurred that are not included in Schedule II, Tariff B, and

(c) to permit the taxing officer to consider factors other than those specified in section 154 when the costs are taxed.

[8] Costs are normally awarded in accordance with the Tariff[2]; unless there are unusual circumstances to deviate from it.

[9] After a consideration of the factors in subsection 147(3) of the Rules and the circumstances of these appeals, I have concluded that the Respondent should be awarded costs on a lump sum basis.

[10] The Respondent was mainly successful in these appeals. Statute barred periods and a statute barred year were opened. Gross negligence penalties and late filing penalties were upheld. The assessments were largely upheld for all Appellants.

[11] There were settlement offers made by both parties. However, neither of the two offers made by the Appellants addressed the issues underlying the appeals. The first offer was made on February 17, 2009 and the individual Appellants offered to settle on a without costs basis if the Minister vacated their assessments. They submitted a second offer on June 15, 2010, in which they offered to pay $55,000 in total, on condition that this would satisfy the tax and GST liabilities, including penalties and interest, for all three Appellants.

[12] On April 13, 2010, prior to the hearing of these appeals, the Respondent made an offer to settle on the basis that the amounts in Garfield and Doreen Crawford’s appeals be reduced by $2,950 and $2,050 for each of the years in issue. In making this offer, the Respondent considered the Appellant’s representations regarding personal expenditures. The result would carry over to the corporate Appellant accordingly. The Appellants rejected this offer without making a counter-offer.

[13] On June 30, 2010, the Respondent made a further offer to settle these appeals on a basis that was more favourable to the Appellants than the result of the judgment. The Appellants did not reply to this settlement offer.

[14] Written settlement offers are one of the main factors which are considered when making an award of costs[3]. The Chief Justice of this Court has stressed the importance of settlement by issuing Practice Note 17 which allows the Court to consider written settlement offers when making an award of costs.

[15] The Appellants’ actions tended to lengthen these proceedings. They refused to submit a joint book of documents; and, they initially refused to admit any of the Minister’s audited numbers, even when presented with the supporting documents. They produced three books of documents which did not appear on their list of documents. They produced partial business records which had never been given to the auditor or appeals officer. All of these productions required that the parties present arguments with respect to the admissibility of the documents.

[16] The Respondent has submitted that its costs, based on the Tariff, are $28,973.89. In the circumstances, I award costs to the Respondent in a lump sum amount of $30,000.
