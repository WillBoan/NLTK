Docket: 2008-2709(IT)G

BETWEEN:

ALEX S. SAPONG,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR TAXATION

[1] This taxation of costs came on for hearing on Thursday, September 29, 2011, by way of telephone conference call. The matter proceeded thirty-five minutes after the appointed time, due to the unavailability of the Appellant. It followed a Judgment of the Honourable Justice Margeson issued on November 22, 2010, dismissing the appeal, with costs to the Respondent. The Appellant represented himself and Mr. Julien Bédard represented the Respondent.

[2] Mr. Sapong’s submissions regarding the Bill of Costs were brief. In summary, he stated that he was objecting to the entire Bill of Costs as it was unfair. He further stated that he was responsible for his own costs and should not be responsible for the costs of the Respondent.

[3] Mr. Bédard stated that the Respondent was entitled to recover costs, in accordance with the Judgment which dismissed Mr. Sapong’s appeal with costs. Mr. Bédard further stated that if Mr. Sapong was dissatisfied with the decision of the Court, he should have filed an appeal of it, which he did not do. He further stated that the amounts claimed on the Bill of Costs were reasonable, in that the counsel fees claimed were in accordance with the Tariff and the disbursements were essential for the conduct of the appeal.

DECISION

[4] Mr. Sapong’s submission that the Court’s award of costs was unfair is of no relevance. Mr. Sapong did not appeal the decision of the Court and having failed to do so, the Respondent is entitled to recover the costs awarded.

[5] I have reviewed the amounts claimed for fees and disbursements. The counsel fees claimed are in accordance with the Tariff and are allowed in the full amount of $2,550.00, which includes $350.00 for this taxation of costs. I am satisfied that the disbursements in the amount of $113.04 were necessary for the conduct of the appeal and are allowed in full.

[6] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and $2,663.04 is allowed.
