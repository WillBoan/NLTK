REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Sheridan J.

[1] This is an appeal from a reassessment by the Minister of National Revenue under the Excise Tax Act dated February 11, 2008 which disallowed the Appellant’s claim for Input Tax Credits (“ITC’s”) for the period April 1 to June 30, 2004 (the “Period”).

[2] The appeal was called for hearing on June 28, 2011 in Cranbrook, British Columbia. Gordon Felske, the principal of the Appellant, testified on behalf of the Appellant.

[3] Upon the resumption of the hearing, counsel for the Respondent advised on behalf of the parties that the Minister was prepared to consent to judgment allowing the appeal, without costs, and referring the matter back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the Appellant was entitled to ITC’s for the Period in the amount of $2,600. Mr. Felske having confirmed the accuracy of the terms set out above, the appeal is allowed accordingly.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 5th day of July 2011.
