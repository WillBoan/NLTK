REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing on Tuesday, February 21, 2012, by way of telephone conference call. The taxation of costs proceeded thirty minutes after the appointed time, without the participation of the Appellant. Mr. Benoit Mandeville represented the Respondent.

[2] The Bill of Costs followed the Judgment of the Honourable Justice Angers dated August 16, 2010, wherein appeals made under the Income Tax Act for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years were dismissed with costs.

[3] The $9,700.00 claimed for counsel fees was in accordance with the Tariff. The disbursements claimed in the amount of $1,280.36 were supported by receipts and I am satisfied that they were essential for the conduct of the appeal. I will allow the full amount claimed for counsel fees and disbursements.
