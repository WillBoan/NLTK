Godin and his workers was initiated as a result of information obtained from the public that Mr. Layne O. Godin was selling stamps, paying high wages and adding work weeks to qualify the workers for full employment insurance benefits or for partial benefits provided for by the Employment Insurance Act (“the Act”).

[6] Mr. Jacques Blanchard, a former inspector with Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (“HRSDC”), testified at the hearing and he explained how the investigation was conducted. The investigation started at the end of 2009 and lasted for seven to eight months. The years under review were 2007 and 2008. During the course of the investigation, 60 of Mr. Layne O. Godin’s workers were interviewed and questionnaires were filled out and signed by the workers in front of Mr. Blanchard or his assistant, Ms. Hélène Lévesque. When a worker made a comment during his interview, it was written down and the worker was asked to initial besides it. Mr. Layne O. Godin refused to be interviewed and did not provide any information at that stage.

[7] Interviews were also conducted with fishermen in general to obtain information on the workings of the industry and from fish buyers who signed receipts for fish deliveries. They confirmed that deliveries were not made every day. Government officials were also consulted to obtain information on the licences required by a fisherman and permits required to cut wood on public and private lands.

[8] Mr. Blanchard formally denied the allegation made by some workers that he made an offer to let their employment insurance claims go through in exchange for a confirmation that Mr. Layne O. Godin was selling stamps.

[9] As a result of the investigation, only two workers had a favourable outcome. The rest were referred to the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a ruling on their insurable hours, insurable earnings and pensionability of their employment with Mr. Layne O. Godin

[10] Mrs. Lucie St-Amour, a complex case review officer with the CRA, testified at the hearing and she described the work undertaken in reviewing the files of the workers. Essentially, she was looking for corroboration between information provided by HRSDC and information gathered from interviews with the workers. She conducted interviews with Mr. Layne O. Godin and most of the workers except for Wayde Godin. A summary of each interview was typed and each page was initialized by the worker and by another CRA’s officer, Mrs. Laura Papineau, who was also present during the interviews.

[11] Ms. St-Amour consulted with officials from Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s and the Forestry Department of New Brunswick. She also spoke to third parties such as the representatives of Lamèque Co-op, Arseneau Fish Market and Mr. Earl Le Bellois of the First Nations.

[12] In terms of documents, Mr. Layne O. Godin submitted the workers’ payslips which were already in the CRA’s files. No Record of Employment (“ROE”), bank statements nor timesheets were provided by Mr. Layne O. Godin at the time of the interview with him.

[13] As a result of her reviews, Ms. St-Amour issued 41 rulings dated March 28, 2011, confirming that:

(a) 21 of the workers were not in insurable employment with Mr. Layne O. Godin;

(b) three of the workers were not Fishers; and

(c) 17 of the workers were in insurable employment with Mr. Layne O. Godin but their insurable hours and earnings for their respective periods of employment had to be re-determined.

[14] All 41 workers appealed their respective ruling to the CPP/EI Appeals division of the CRA. Mrs. Brigitte Gagnon was the appeals officer who dealt with the workers’ appeals. It took her a year and a half to review the files. She prepared a Fact Finding Questionnaire that was filled out by each worker. She spoke to third parties concerning the forestry and fishing industry and she did comparisons.

[15] For the workers working during the crab fishing season, Mrs. Gagnon concluded that the wages paid were reasonable but that the working hours were inflated. Individuals working in that industry, work on average 55 hours per week, more at the beginning of the season and less at the end. No worker works 12 hours per day, seven days a week during the entire season from mid-August to mid-October.

[16] For the workers cutting wood, Ms. Gagnon found out that a licence was required to cut wood on Crown and private lands but no permits were obtained by those workers. Furthermore, no record of wood sales during the 2007, 2008 and 2009 years were filed as evidence and the owner of the private farm where the wood was alleged to have been cut told Mrs. Gagnon that there was no commercial wood cutting on his farm except for his own personal consumption.

The Position of Mr. Layne O. Godin

[17] Mr. Layne O. Godin’s appeal applies to all 41 workers even if only five of them formally filed an appeal with this Court.

[18] Mr. Layne O. Godin testified at the hearing. He essentially provided general information on his fishing and forestry operations and the work performed by his workers. Mr. Godin explained that he hires two or three workers for three weeks in April in preparation for the lobster season which is from April 30 to June 30. The work to be done during the pre-lobster season consists of checking, repairing and painting the traps, delivering the traps to the wharves, checking and repairing the nets for herring fishing and ensuring that the boats will be in good condition for the fishing season. One boat is used for fishing herring and the biggest boat is used for fishing lobster. The crews on the boats consisted of the same three persons in 2007 and 2008, that is, Mr. Layne O. Godin himself, Tommy Carrier and Nicholas Slugger. In 2009, Nicholas Slugger was replaced by Patrick Lévesque.

[19] In terms of documentary evidence, Mr. Godin submitted the following documents:

− the registration of his three boats used for fishing lobster and herring;

− invoices for the delivery of baits to the Arseneau Fish Market which show that he was in operation during the month of April of each year;

− the truck inspection reports showing that he had six or seven trucks in 2007;

− a map showing from where he purchased crabs;

− receipts from Arseneau Fish Market showing trips made by Lucien Carrier;

− purchase and sale of lobsters by Jacques Doucet;

− the timesheets prepared by Tracy Esliger;

− payments for the purchases of lobster for three years;

− T-4 slips prepared by Tracy Esliger issued to crab fishermen;

− receipts for wood delivered to Bathurst in 2010 but cut in 2009;

− receipts from the Arseneau Fish Market showing that he was still in operation during the month of July of each year.

[20] Every April, Mr. Layne O. Godin purchases baits for herring fishing from Lamèque Co-op and delivers them to fishermen and to the Arseneau Fish Market. Mr. Godin prepares the invoices for the sale of the baits before their deliveries. Sale of the baits are cash operations. For the suppliers of crabs, the costs of the baits delivered to them are deducted from the sale of crabs to Mr. Layne O. Godin.

[21] Mr. Layne O. Godin explained that the timesheets were prepared by Tracy Esliger but that he also kept track himself of the working hours of all workers. The workers had to report to his place at the beginning and at the end of each working day, except for the wood cutters who went directly to the farmlands as they were paid by production. Mr. Godin said that he then provided the information to Tracy Esliger for preparation of the timesheets.

[22] All workers were paid in cash for work done the preceding week at the end of their shifts on Fridays at Mr. Layne O. Godin’s place.

[23] During the lobster season, Mr. Layne O. Godin also purchases lobsters from the fishermen on the wharves and sell them to the public on the wharves and to fish markets in the region. All lobster transactions are in cash. Mr. Layne O. Godin said that he makes a profit of $1.50 to $2.00 on a pound of lobster. Mr. Jacques Doucet, one of the Appellants, was principally involved in the purchase and sale of lobster on behalf of Mr. Layne O. Godin who advanced him money so that he could pay for the lobsters. During the lobster season, Mr. Layne O. Godin usually employs three workers on the boat and three on land.

[24] Mr. Layne O. Godin explained that the crab fishing season begins on the first Monday of August and ends at the end of October and that it is busier at the beginning of the season. At the end of July, the truck drivers would go to Lamèque Co-op to pick up baits which are then delivered to fishermen. The amount charged for the baits to the suppliers of crabs are then deducted from the sale of the crabs to Mr. Layne O. Godin. Sales of the baits are paid in cash. During the crab fishing season, Mr. Layne O. Godin buys crabs from different fishermen and delivers them to the Lamèque Co-op and to fish markets like the Arseneau Fish Market. Because there are quotas for crabs, one appointed monitor has to be present when the crabs are unloaded from the fishing boats. There is only one monitor for fishing zone #23 and this explains why the truck drivers often have to wait on the wharves. The normal working hours for the workers during the crab season are from 7 or 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Their work essentially consists of loading the crabs in the trucks, washing the crabs and the trucks, unloading the crabs from the trucks if they cannot be delivered immediately. Deliveries usually take place from 6 p.m. to midnight. During the crab season, Mr. Layne O. Godin employed between 8 to 10 full-time workers and 7 or 8 part-time workers.

[25] Mr. Layne O. Godin explained that the wood cutting activities took place on a private farm from August 2 to October 10, 2009 only. In 2007 and 2008, the wood was cut by the native people. The workers then simply skinned the wood and transported it to Bathurst where it was sold. In 2007, Mr. Layne O. Godin had only two workers involved in that activity but, in 2008, he hired two more workers. According to Mr. Layne O. Godin, the gross revenue generated by the wood cutting operations was approximately $50 000 in 2009, $48 000 to $49 000 in 2008 and $45 000 in 2007.

[26] Ms. Christine Carrier, the intervenor in Mr. Layne O. Godin’s appeal, testified at the hearing. She stated that her own claim for employment insurance benefits was cut off. She worked for Mr. Layne O. Godin for five weeks starting the first week of August 2009. She provided cleaning services, mostly at Mr. Layne O. Godin’s house, for a few hours mainly in the evenings. While working for Mr. Godin, Ms. Carrier was also working at Denny’s restaurant from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. She lived in Belle Dune which is about a 40-minute drive from Mr. Godin’s house. At the hearing, she said that she kept a record of her working hours on a calendar, that she received her payslips prepared by Mr. Godin at the end of the week and that she was always paid in cash on Saturdays by Mr. Godin. She stated that she did not see anybody at Mr. Godin’s house while working there. She could not give the name of any person she may have seen on Mr. Godin’s property inside or outside the house.

[27] Ms. Carrier was interviewed on two occasions: the first time by Hélène Lévesque and the second time by Lucie St. Amour. She was also asked to answer two questionnaires. There are many contradictions between her testimony in Court and her answers to the questionnaires concerning the way she kept records of her working hours, the work performed for Mr. Godin and the exact place where she performed the work. In summary, the witness was not credible.

Steven Esliger

[28] Mr. Esliger worked for Mr. Layne O. Godin during the crab seasons of August 10 to October 13, 2007 and August 15 to October 18, 2008 and during the lobster season of May 15 to June 27, 2009. His appeal is only for the 2007 and 2008 years because the CRA reduced his insurable hours and wages for those two years. For 2009, the CRA increased his insurable hours and wages.

[29] His work during the crab season consisted of unloading crabs from the fishermen’s boats, weighing the crabs and loading the crabs in the trucks. He said that these activities required five to six workers on the wharves. Mr. Godin had his own scale but did not have any crane. During the 2007 and 2008 crab seasons, he claimed that he worked seven days a week, 12 hours a day. He was paid $10 an hour in 2007 and $12 an hour in 2008.

[30] He testified that he kept track of his working hours in a book but he did not file any document proving that fact. No fishermen were subpoenaed to confirm the seven days a week of crab loading during the crab season.

[31] Mr. Lucien Carrier was a truck driver who worked for Mr. Layne O. Godin during the 2007, 2008 and 2009 crab seasons. His day of work usually started at noon at Mr. Layne O. Godin’s house where he takes a truck (usually the eight-ton truck). His first task was to go to Arseneau’s Fish Market to pick-up crabs and to drive back to Mr. Godin’s house where part of the crabs was unloaded. Mr. Carrier would go home between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. for rest and supper and would return to Mr. Godin’s house to deliver the rest of the crabs at Lamèque Co-op where the crabs were unloaded by employees of the cooperative using their own equipment. The truck was then loaded with baits and ice. Mr. Carrier drove back to Mr. Godin’s house late in the evening. In his testimony, Mr. Carrier stated that during his trips to Lamèque he was often accompanied by his girlfriend and a brother-in-law.

[32] During cross-examination, Mr. Carrier stated that he did not go to Lamèque Co-op everyday. Sometimes there was no need to go to Lamèque Co‑op because there were no crab transactions or because bad weather prevented the fishermen from going to sea. On those days, he would work reduced hours at Mr. Godin’s house. He also pointed out that near the end of the season, there is usually less crab being caught which results in a reduced number of trips to Lamèque.

Jacques Doucet

[33] Mr. Jacques Doucet worked for Mr. Layne O. Godin during the 2007, 2008 and 2009 lobster seasons from mid-April to the beginning of July. His job was to go to the wharves to buy lobsters directly from the fishermen. Since the lobsters had to be paid in cash, Mr. Godin advanced him approximately $5,000 for this purpose.

[34] Mr. Doucet testified that he was working alone and that his working day started between 6 to 8 a.m. at Mr. Godin’s house. He took a truck and Mr. Godin assigned him places to go. He had to be on the wharves between 11:30 a.m. and 4:35 p.m. The wharves were located at Jack River, Petit Rocher and Pointe Verte. He said he worked seven days a week and that during a lobster season, only five to six days were lost due to bad weather.

[35] Mr. Doucet testified that he was the sole owner of a fish market located close to his house and that during the lobster season, he hired two or three full-time employees. He confirmed that he never sold the lobster he bought for Mr. Godin at his own fish market.

[36] Mr. Wayde Godin is Mr. Layne O. Godin’s brother and was hired for the 2007, 2008 and 2009 crab seasons. His main task was to take care of the maintenance of the vehicles and to wash the crab traps. His working hours at Mr. Layne O. Godin’s house were from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. He was always present on site except when he had to purchase parts for the trucks.

[37] Mr. Kelly Godin is not related to Mr. Layne O. Godin. From August 2, 2009 to October 10, 2009, he worked for Mr. Layne O. Godin cutting wood on a private farm located about a 10-minute drive away from his house. He has a lot of experience and know how to handle a chain saw. His working hours were from 5 a.m. to 8 or 9 p.m. seven days a week. He worked with two other workers of Mr. Layne O. Godin, Rocky and Clayton Hickey.

[38] The legislative provisions on which the Minister relied in making the determinations are found in subsection 6(1) of the Canada Pension Plan, paragraphs 5(1)(a), 5(2)(i) and subsection 5(3) of the Act, section 9.1 or subsection 10(3) of the EIR, subsection 2(1) of the IECPR, sections 1 and 2 of the Fishing Regulations and paragraphs 251(1)(a) and (c), paragraph 251(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act. They read as follows:

6 (1) Pensionable employment is

(a) employment in Canada that is not excepted employment;

5 (1) Subject to subsection (2), insurable employment is

(a) employment in Canada by one or more employers, under any express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether the earnings of the employed person are received from the employer or some other person and whether the earnings are calculated by time or by the piece, or partly by time and partly by the piece, or otherwise;

Excluded employment

(2) Insurable employment does not include

(i) employment if the employer and employee are not dealing with each other at arm’s length.

(b) if the employer is, within the meaning of that Act, related to the employee, they are deemed to deal with each other at arm’s length if the Minister of National Revenue is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the employment, including the remuneration paid, the terms and conditions, the duration and the nature and importance of the work performed, it is reasonable to conclude that they would have entered into a substantially similar contract of employment if they had been dealing with each other at arm’s length.

Hours of Insurable Employment — Methods of Determination

9.1 Where a person's earnings are paid on an hourly basis, the person is considered to have worked in insurable employment for the number of hours that the person actually worked and for which the person was remunerated.

10(3) Where the number of hours agreed to by the employer and the worker or group of workers under subsection (2) is not reasonable or no agreement can be reached, each worker is deemed to have worked the number of hours in insurable employment established by the Minister of National Revenue, based on an examination of the terms and conditions of the employment and a comparison with the number of hours normally worked by workers performing similar tasks or functions in similar occupations and industries.

Earnings from Insurable Employment

2(1) For the purposes of the definition insurable earnings in subsection 2(1) of the Act and for the purposes of these Regulations, the total amount of earnings that an insured person has from insurable employment is

(a) the total of all amounts, whether wholly or partly pecuniary, received or enjoyed by the insured person that are paid to the person by the person’s employer in respect of that employment, and

. . .

(c) in any other case, it is a question of fact whether persons not related to each other are, at a particular time, dealing with each other at arm’s length.

Definition of “related persons”

(2) For the purpose of this Act, “related persons”, or persons related to each other, are

(a) individuals connected by blood relationship, marriage or common-law partnership or adoption;

[39] My first observation is that the workers and Mr. Layne O. Godin were given a lot of opportunities to provide HRSDC and the CRA documents to corroborate the work they performed and explanations corroborating the fact that seven to ten workers worked 12-hour days, seven days a week during the lobster and crab seasons despite fluctuations in weather conditions and diminishing stocks of resources at the end of the fishing seasons.

[40] In terms of evidence put forward by the various Appellants, there were many inconsistencies in what the workers and Mr. Layne O. Godin said to the various inspectors and officers of HRSDC and the CRA. There were also inconsistencies amongst themselves.

[41] Mr. Layne O. Godin’s evidence consisted primarily of documents prepared by persons who did not come to testify in Court and therefore could not be cross-examined to authenticate the documents. For instance, according to Mr. Godin, the payslips and timesheets for the workers were prepared by Tracy Esliger. She did not testify in Court to confirm that she did prepare the payslips, the timesheets and the T-4s and to describe the procedure followed to collect the information for that purpose. We also do not know who prepared the invoices from Arseneau Fish Market and these persons could not be cross-examined to confirm the accuracy of the invoices or the actual circumstances that led to the purchases of fish, crabs and lobsters in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

[42] Mr. Layne O. Godin’s testimony was not accurate in many aspects. For example, he said that, during the crab season, he employed seven to eight workers on land but when asked to provide the names of these workers for 2007, he could not do so.

[43] Another example of contradictory evidence by Mr. Layne O. Godin was regarding the drivers of the eight-ton truck. He testified that Jacques Doucet, Lucien Carrier and Wayde Godin drove the eight-ton truck for deliveries to the Lamèque Co-op. During Mr. Lucien Carrier’s cross-examination, he explained that a Class 2 license was required in order to drive the eight-ton truck. When asked to produce his license, he admitted that he did not hold a Class 2 license. Finally, Mr. Wayde Godin testified that his duties were primarily to clean the crates and do the maintenance of the trucks. He never testified that he drove the eight-ton truck.

[44] Mr. Layne O. Godin also testified that Christine Carrier was hired on a part-time basis to clean crates and trucks. However, Ms. Carrier indicated on the questionnaires that her primary responsibility was to do housework. She was also unable to name any of the workers who would have cleaned the crates and trucks with her, as the evidence shows that seven or eight workers were cleaning crates and trucks at one time. Strangely enough, she also said that she never saw any other workers on Mr. Godin’s property while she was there.

[45] Mr. Layne O. Godin testified that his workers worked Sundays to Saturdays and were paid on the following Friday. They all had to sign a payslip and were paid in cash. They were paid in person every Friday at the end of their shifts, between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. The evidence given by Christine Carrier contradicted Mr. Godin’s evidence in many aspects. For example, she testified that Mr. Godin prepared the workers’ payslips and that she was paid on Saturdays. In the questionnaires that she provided to both HRSDC and the CRA between February 2010 and February 2012, she testified that she would cash her paycheques at the bank or at times, Mr. Layne O. Godin would cash them for her.

[46] Mr. Stephen Esliger’s testimony at the hearing also contradicted the answers he gave during the HRSDC and CRA interviews in February and November 2010. He testified that he worked seven days a week, 12 hours a day while his payslips do not reflect this nor do the timesheets submitted on his behalf. During the trial, he testified that Mr. Layne O. Godin wrote down the payslips in front of him which is in direct contradiction with Mr. Godin’s testimony who said that the payslips were prepared by Tracy Esliger. Moreover, at the hearing, Mr. Stephen Esliger testified that he was paid in cash whereas he said to the integrity branch investigators that he was paid by cheques and that he gave his cheques to his mother who took care of his banking.

[47] Mr. Lucien Carrier testified that he did not keep track of his working hours and did not know that the hours on his payslips did not correspond to the hours on the records of employment issued to him for 2007, 2008 and 2009. Each of these Records of Employment had inflated hours when compared to the payslips. Mr. Carrier could not name any other workers present at Mr. Layne O. Godin’s house when he would go there at noon to get the truck and around 5 p.m. to go to Lamèque Co-op despite the fact that most workers testified that they worked 12 hours a day starting at 8 a.m., 7 days a week. He also testified that even when there was no need to go to Lamèque because it was too windy to fish crab, he would work reduced hours at Mr. Layne O. Godin’s house.

[48] Mr. Jacques Doucet testified that he was buying lobster for Mr. Layne O. Godin seven days a week, 12 hours a day. Mr. Doucet confirmed in his testimony that he had his own business of selling lobster from his own fish market. As documentary evidence, Mr. Layne O. Godin tendered various documents, in particular sale slips from Labillois Lobster and Arseneau Fish Market. Ms. Labillois was not called as a witness to authenticate those sale slips, nor did we have anyone from Arseneau Fish Market. Furthermore, the sale slips do not assist Mr. Doucet’s appeal since they were all addressed either to Mr. Doucet personally or to Doucet Fish Market and not to Mr. Layne O. Godin.

[49] Mr. Wayde Godin testified that he was washing the crab traps and the trucks and did maintenance on the trucks on Mr. Layne O. Godin’s property. He said that he worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week but no other worker working 12 hours a day, seven days a week mentioned having seen him at Mr. Godin’s house or to be one of the workers.

[50] Mr. Kelly Godin testified that he worked 13 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, cutting wood on a property which was four acres wide and 50 to 100 acres deep. He never mentioned that this land was intended to be clear cut and never explained how the trees were marked so as to identify them for cutting. There is no cogent or credible evidence that Mr. Kelly Godin was cutting wood during the 2007, 2008 and 2009 years nor if any wood was sold during those years. Some invoices from mills dated from 2010 were submitted but those invoices fall in the category of self-serving documents as no one was called to testify on behalf of these mills to confirm they had been purchasing wood from Mr. Godin during the appeal period.

[51] All the workers are not credible witnesses. They all testified that they did not have a bank account but, when cross-examined, they admitted that they received employment insurance benefits and that they needed a bank account to cash their cheques. No one gave consistent answers to HRSDC and the CRA during the various stages of the process and finally nor to this Court either. No additional evidence was submitted during this trial than what was already available at each stage of the review process with respect to the determination of insurable hours or earnings or whether the workers actually worked for Mr. Layne O. Godin.

[52] For all these reasons, the appeals are dismissed.
