REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on Thursday, June 4, 2009. It follows a Judgment of the Honourable Justice Cameron Hugh McArthur of this Court dated August 19, 2005. As a result of the limited success of the Appellants, one set of costs was awarded to the Respondent. Mr. Hikmat Alsayegh represented the Appellants and Mr. Bruce Senkpiel represented the Respondent.

[2] The Further Amended Bill of Costs submitted by the Respondent is as follows:

1.(1) Services of Counsel:

1(1)(a) For all services in a proceeding prior to examination $525.00

for discovery

1(1)(b) For a discovery of documents $150.00

1(1)(c) For an examination for discovery on October 18 and $1,050.00

19, 2004 (2 at $525.00 per day or part day)

1(1)(c) For a taxation of costs $525.00

1(1)(d) For a pre-hearing conference March 19, 2003 and April $700.00

27, 2005 (2 at $350.00 per day or part day)

1(1)(e) For a status hearing May 2, 2002 (1 at $125.00 per day $125.00

or part day)

1(1)(g) For preparation for hearing $625.00

1(1)(h) For conduct of the hearing May 30 and May 31, 2005, $3,000.00

for each day or part day (2 at $1,500.00 per day or

part day)

1(1)(i) For all services after judgment $300.00

TOTAL FEES: $7,000.00

1.(2) Disbursements

Discovery Transcripts $1,377.00

Court Reporter fee $500.00

Courier $229.81

Photocopying $2,314.35

Service (Dye & Durham) $245.00

TOTAL DISBURSEMENTS: $4,666.18

TOTAL FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS: $11,666.16

[3] All of the items claimed on the Respondent’s Bill of Costs were in dispute. As a result, Mr. Senkpiel reviewed and provided an explanation for each item claimed.

[4] Prior to hearing Mr. Alsayegh’s submissions, a discrepancy in the amount claimed for photocopying was identified, in that an invoice in the amount of $170.69 from St. Joseph Print Group Inc. had been claimed twice. Mr. Senkpiel withdrew the sum of $170.69 from the amount claimed for photocopies which reduced the claim for photocopies to $2,143.66.

[5] Mr. Alsayegh challenged the amounts claimed for services of counsel and disbursements. He argued that the amounts claimed were "inflated" and that he should not have to pay.

[6] I do not agree with Mr. Alsayegh. The amounts claimed for counsel fees are proper and in accordance with Tariff B of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure). I will accordingly allow the full amount claimed for counsel fees of $7,000.00.

[7] The amounts claimed for disbursements were well documented. Two Affidavits of Documents, with copies of invoices attached as exhibits, were filed for use at this hearing. I will accordingly allow the amount of $4,495.00 for disbursements.

[8] The bill of costs in the amount of $11,666.16 is taxed and $11,495.47 is allowed. A certificate in that amount will be issued.
