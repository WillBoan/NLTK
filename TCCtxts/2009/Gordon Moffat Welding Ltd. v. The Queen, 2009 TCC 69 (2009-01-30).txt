REASONS FOR ORDER

(Delivered orally from the Bench on January 28, 2009.)

Woods J.

[1] Mr. Ostrom – I do not see any basis to prolong this hearing. I do not see how I can allow these applications even if your witnesses support the facts that you are alleging.

[2] As you know, the statute sets out a time period for applying for an extension of time. The time period starts to run from the time the Minister has confirmed the assessments. The confirmations in this case were made long before these applications were made and I have no authority to overlook this deadline.

[3] You have argued that you did not have sufficient information in time to properly prepare an appeal and that the appeals officer was still reviewing your case after the confirmations were issued. Unfortunately the statutory deadlines do not allow me to take these considerations into account.

[4] Where a taxpayer does not have sufficient information to give full reasons for an appeal, the appropriate procedure is to file a notice of appeal in time based on the limited information that is available. Any additional information obtained later could be provided in an amendment to the notice of appeal. Unfortunately for the applicants the statutory deadline is a firm one and I have no authority to overlook it.

[5] For these reasons, I will have to dismiss the applications.

Signed at Edmonton, Alberta this 30th day of January 2009.
