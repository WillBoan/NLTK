REASONS FOR ORDER

V.A. Miller, J.

[1] The Appellant has brought two motions; one was filed on September 11, 2009 and the other was filed on September 16, 2009. Schedule A, attached to these reasons contains the relief sought by the Appellant.

[2] The Appellant filed his notices of appeal more than ten years ago for the 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 taxation years. His appeals were part of a group of appeals which were involved in a convertible hedge strategy.

Motion filed on September 11

Accounts at BMO/Nesbitt – items 1, 2 and 4, page 1 of Schedule A

[3] The relief sought cannot be given on a motion. These are issues that require evidence to be adduced which can be done at the hearing of these appeals.

Investigations by the Court – items 3 and 5, page 1 of Schedule A

[4] This court is not an investigative body. It does not have the jurisdiction to independently procure evidence to be used in a trial. Nor does this court have the jurisdiction to provide guidelines as to how a matter should be settled.

[5] The Tax Court of Canada has jurisdiction to hear appeals on matters arising under the Income Tax Act (the “Act”). Within this jurisdiction, in an appeal under the Act this Court may dispose of an appeal by dismissing it; or allowing it and (i) vacating the assessment, (ii) varying the assessment, or (iii) referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment.

Adjournment – item 6, page 1 and item 17, page 2 of Schedule A

[6] These appeals are scheduled for hearing on November 16, 2009 and the request for an adjournment is denied.

Motion filed on September 16

Mandamus – items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 18 and 19, page 2 of Schedule A

[7] The relief sought by the Appellant is an order in the nature of mandamus. This is a remedy that this court does not have the jurisdiction to grant[1].

Factual Matters – items 4, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16, page 2 of Schedule A

[8] The relief sought by the Appellant involves findings of fact which require evidence. These are matters that are more appropriately dealt with by the trial judge.

[9] These motions are dismissed with costs in the amount of $1,400 payable forthwith to the Respondent.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 22nd day of October 2009.

THIS MOTION IS FOR:

1.For this Court to note that the account at BMO/Nesbitt with Peter McCrodan from 1984 to 1988 did not operate in the same manner as the same sort of accounts operated by other brokers at BMO/Nesbitt or other brokers at other brokerage/banks that this appellant used during the same years.

2.For this Court to realize that the trades at BMO/Nesbitt for 1984 to 1988 were carried in several different ways which would have impact on the way the calculation of each trade should be done.

8.For this Court to Clarify as to when the imply decision of the guarantee agreements was really started, is it sill going on and will it ever stop? Did it apply to exact type of trades and agreements before 1984, or was it just conceived in 1993 with the “Schultz Decision”?
