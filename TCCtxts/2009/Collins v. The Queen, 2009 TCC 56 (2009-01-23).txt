REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

V.A. Miller, J.

[1] These appeals were heard on common evidence and the only issue was whether in the 1994, 1995 and 1996 taxation years, the Appellants could each deduct interest in the amounts of $77,186, $80,127 and $84,391 respectively. I will refer to these amounts as the “interest”.

[2] The evidence in these appeals consisted of a Statement of Admitted Facts (attached hereto as Schedule “A”) and several documents, all filed by the Appellants, and the testimony of Eugene Collins. A summary of that evidence follows.

[3] In the early 1980’s, the Alberta government encouraged the construction of apartment buildings in urban areas by means of a financing program known as the Core Housing Incentive Program (the “CHIP Program”). By way of a mortgage dated April 9, 1981 (the “Original Mortgage”), the Appellants received $1,840,725 from Alberta Mortgage and Housing Corporation (“AMHC”), pursuant to the CHIP program.

[4] The Original Mortgage was for 15 years at 8 ¾% with monthly payments of $13,368.32. This payment included principal and interest and was due as of January 1, 1982.

[5] As equal partners, the Appellants constructed a 39 unit apartment building at 1010, 13 Avenue S.W. in Calgary, Alberta (“the Apartment”). The land on which the Apartment was built was owned by The Shelburne Group Ltd. (“Shelburne”), an Alberta corporation which was owned equally by the Appellants.

[6] In accordance with a Trust Agreement dated September 1, 1981, Shelburne acted as agent for the Appellants with respect to all matters pertaining to the Apartment.

[7] Between 1984 and 1987, the Appellants had problems meeting their obligations under the Original Mortgage; and, in 1987, AMHC did a restructuring so that the interest rate was deferred from 8 ¾% to 6 ¼%. The deferred interest was added to the loan amount of the mortgage. It was Mr. Collins’ evidence that the Appellants were able to meet their obligations under the 1987 agreement.

[8] Mr. Collins stated that the Alberta government was concerned because it was deferring interest on apartment buildings while at the same time foreclosing on individual owners. The evidence showed that by 1993, the loan amount of the Original Mortgage on the Apartment had increased to $2,692,921.81 as a result of the deferred interest.

[9] In 1991 the AMHC was wound down and Municipal Affairs – Sales Ltd. (“MASL”), an Alberta Crown Corporation, was given the authority to negotiate the termination of agreements entered into by AMHC[1].

[10] The Appellants began negotiations with MASL in 1991 and reached a settlement in April 1993. They tendered a settlement letter and a commitment letter, both dated April 27, 1993, from MASL. The first paragraph of the settlement letter reads as follows:

“Re: Mortgage Loan No. 1091453

Shelburne Group Ltd.

Further to our letter dated April 7, 1993 and our subsequent conversation, Municipal Affairs – Sales Ltd. (“MASL”) has agreed to amend the terms of settlement outlined therein and is now agreeable to settling the above captioned mortgage loan on the following terms:” [2]

[11] The terms in both the settlement and commitment letters were subsequently captured in a Loan Agreement and Mortgage Amending Agreement dated July 22, 1993 (“the Amending Agreement”) between MASL and the Appellants.

[12] Relevant paragraphs from the Amending Agreement are as follows:

B. The Borrower and the Lender have agreed to refinance a portion of the Debt and to amend the Mortgage to provide an arrangement whereby:

(i) a new loan will be made to the Borrower on the security, inter alia, of the Lands and the proceeds therefrom will be used to paydown the Mortgage; and

(ii) the obligations of the Borrower to repay the balance of the Debt will be amended;

C.

1.3 “Debt” means monies owing by the Borrower to the Lender, of which the sum of $2,692,921.81 remained owning as of May 11, 1993;

1.5 “Mortgage” means the mortgage charge held by the Lender as security for the Debt and registered against the Lands in the South Alberta Land Registration District as instrument number 811078474;

4. Concurrently herewith the Borrower agrees to execute and deliver to the Lender the following:

(i) the New Mortgage;

(ii) an Assignment of Rents arising from the Lands;

(iii) A General Security Agreement respecting the Chattels; and

(iv) a Guarantee, on the Lender’s form, from EUGENE F. COLLINS and FLEURETTE M. COLLINS, guaranteeing repayment of the Borrower’s obligations under the New Mortgage.

5. Following registration of the New Mortgage, receipt of all other security required by paragraph 4 above, and upon the Lender receiving the opinion of its counsel that all requirements of the New Mortgage are in place, the Lender shall postpone the Mortgage and security collateral to the New Mortgage, and shall apply the proceeds of the New Mortgage in reduction of the Debt.

6. The Lender and the Borrower agree that the Mortgage shall be amended and varied as follows:

(i) TERM: 20 years from August 1, 1993;

(ii) INTEREST: 10% simple interest to be calculated and paid annually on AUGUST 1st of each year subject to the payment provision below for the first 15 years of the term;

(iii) PAYMENTS: Minimum annual interest payments of $20,000.00 for each of the first 15 years of the amended term due on or before AUGUST 1st of each year. At the end of the 16th year of the term, any remaining unpaid accrued interest is immediately due and payable and thereafter, interest shall be paid in accordance with subparagraph (ii) above. The principal sum outstanding shall be paid on or before JULY 31, 2013;

(iv) EARLY PAYOUT: The Borrower may at its option, at any time, up to JULY 31, 2008, pay all interest and principal monies outstanding upon payment of the sum of $100,000.00 plus payment of all the FIFTEEN (15) minimum $20,000.00 annual interest payments unpaid which total payment shall be applied firstly to all outstanding interest due to the date of early payout and secondly to principal.

8. The execution of this Agreement shall not constitute or cause a merger of the obligations of the Borrower or any Guarantors with respect to payment of the Debt, or of the terms of the Mortgage, the Mortgage Amending Agreement or the Security. The Guarantors hereby approve of and consent to the terms of this Agreement.

13. This Agreement does not constitute an accord and satisfaction between the Borrower and the Lender with respect to the indebtedness secured by the Security which Security shall not in anyway be discharged, released or prejudiced by this Agreement. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Mortgage shall continue in full force and effect as a charge upon the Lands and shall remain unchanged except as specifically amended and varied herein.

14. This Agreement is intended to be, shall operate as, shall be construed as and shall constitute a Mortgage Amending Agreement and not a novation of the Mortgage and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be, constitute or operate as a release or waiver of any personal covenant or covenants contained in the Mortgage. Should there be any inconsistency between the terms of the Mortgage and of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

[13] In accordance with the Amending Agreement, the Appellants entered into a New Mortgage, also dated July 22, 1993, for a loan amount of $1,200,000. This amount was applied to the existing debt. The Original Mortgage was postponed to the New Mortgage.

[14] In accordance with the payment provision of the Amending Agreement, the Appellants paid the minimum annual interest payments of $20,000 for 1994, 1995 and 1996. They have been given a deduction for their proportionate share of this amount in each year.

[15] During the years under appeal, the total unpaid interest amounts under the Original Mortgage were $154,372, $160,254 and $168,782 in 1994, 1995 and 1996. These amounts were added to the loan amount by MASL. The Appellants tendered a document dated May 15, 1995, entitled Amended Annual Mortgage Account Statement which detailed the accrued interest and the outstanding loan amount on the Original Mortgage up to December 31, 1994.

[16] It was Mr. Collins evidence that the Appellants reported their income on an accrual basis.

[17] It is agreed by the Appellants that the “interest” was not paid nor would it ever be paid. It was Mr. Collins evidence that the Appellants intended to pay the remaining minimum annual interest payment of $20,000 and the lump sum of $100,000 by July 31, 2008. They intended to realize an early payout of the Original Mortgage in accordance with paragraph 6(iv) of the Amending Agreement. As a result of these payments, the debt would be extinguished.

Appellants’ Position

[18] Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the debt obligation evidenced by the Original Mortgage came into existence and remained outstanding in the years under appeal. The Respondent has conceded that there was no debt forgiveness during the relevant period. The interest obligation relating to that debt was subsisting until it was satisfied or expired and could not be separated from the mortgage itself. Counsel relied on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Wawang Forest Products[3] to support his argument that the interest obligation was not a contingent liability. He stated that the mere fact that it was subject to reduction did not mean that the interest obligation was contingent.

[19] It was the Appellant’s position that the legal obligation to pay interest came into existence when the Original Mortgage was signed; it continued throughout under the Amending Agreement. Counsel stated that the “interest” accrued, but it did not have to be paid until the 16th year in accordance with paragraph 6(iii) of the Amending Agreement[4]. At the end of the 16th year, any remaining accrued “interest” would be immediately due and payable unless it was extinguished through other events. In support of his argument, counsel referred to paragraphs 4 and 10 of the Original Mortgage. I have reproduced those paragraphs as Schedule B, attached.

[20] Counsel for the Appellant stated that as the debt came into existence under the Original Mortgage and continued to exist under the Amending Agreement, there was a legal obligation to pay the “interest” on that debt; the “interest” was payable and was therefore deductible.

Respondent’s Position

[21] In reassessing the Appellants, the Minister of National Revenue (the “Minister”) had assumed both that the liability to pay the “interest” was contingent; and, that there was no legal obligation in existence to pay the “interest” in the years under appeal. At the hearing, counsel for the Respondent argued only that there was no legal obligation to pay the “interest” in the years in question.

[22] It was the Respondent’s position that, in accordance with the Amending Agreement, the legal obligation to pay interest was divided into two parts: one was to pay $20,000 a year on the first of each August for fifteen years; the second obligation, to pay the remaining “interest”, only came into effect at the end of the 16th year.

Analysis

[23] Both parties have agreed that the amount of “interest” did not have to be paid in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Whether the amounts were “payable”, depends on the meaning of that term.

[24] The statutory provision is subparagraph 20(1)(c)(i) of the Income Tax Act (the “Act”) which provides as follows:

20. (1) Deductions permitted in computing income from business or property -- Notwithstanding paragraphs 18(1)(a), (b) and (h), in computing a taxpayer's income for a taxation year from a business or property, there may be deducted such of the following amounts as are wholly applicable to that source or such part of the following amounts as may reasonably be regarded as applicable thereto:

(c) interest -- an amount paid in the year or payable in respect of the year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the taxpayer in computing the taxpayer's income), pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on

(i) borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property (other than borrowed money used to acquire property the income from which would be exempt or to acquire a life insurance policy),

or a reasonable amount in respect thereof, whichever is the lesser;

[25] Paragraph 20(1)(c) of the Act is an exception to the rule that interest paid on capital is not deductible.[5] The Supreme Court of Canada has recently reiterated the purpose of this paragraph in its decision in Lipson v. Canada[6] as follows:

[29] Section 20(1)(c) allows taxpayers to deduct interest on borrowed money used for a commercial purpose. The purpose of this provision is to “create an incentive to accumulate capital with the potential to produce income” (Ludco Enterprises Ltd. v. Canada, 2001 SCC 62, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1082, at para. 63), or to “encourage the accumulation of capital which would produce taxable income” (Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 622, at para. 57).

[26] In order for the Appellants to deduct the “interest” amounts in paragraph 1 above, the four elements of paragraph 20(1)(c) must be met[7]. These elements, as listed in Shell Canada Ltd., are: (1) the amount of interest must be paid in the year or be payable in the year in which it is sought to be deducted; (2) the amount of interest must be paid pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on borrowed money; (3) the borrowed money must be used for the purpose of earning non-exempt income from a business or property; and, (4) the amount of interest must be reasonable, as assessed by reference to the first three requirements.

[27] It was the Respondent’s position that the Appellants did not meet the first, second and fourth elements. I agree.

[28] The Dictionary of Canadian Law defines “payable” as:

1. Requiring to be paid; due. 2. Describes a sum of money when someone is obliged to pay it.

The Canadian Oxford Dictionary defines “payable” as:

1. that must be paid; due; 2. that may be paid.

The Law.com Dictionary defines “payable” as:

1. adj. referring to a debt which is due. A debt may be owed, but not yet payable until a certain date or event.

2. n. a debt which is due. "Payables" are all the liabilities (debts) of a business.

[29] I interpret the word “payable” in paragraph 20(1)(c) to mean that the interest must be “required to be paid” or “due” as opposed to owing. Interest is “payable” when there is an obligation to pay in the present as opposed to an obligation to pay in the future.

[30] In accordance with paragraph 6 of the Amending Agreement, the “interest” was not due nor was it required to be paid in the years under appeal. As long as the Appellants met the terms of the Amending Agreement, the mortgagee could not demand the accrued “interest”[8]. I conclude that the “interest” was not payable in the years in which it was sought to be deducted and the first element of paragraph 20(1)(c) has not been met.

[31] Although my conclusion in the above paragraph is sufficient to answer the question under appeal, I will examine the remaining elements of paragraph 20(1)(c) of the Act in light of the facts in these appeals.

[32] It is my opinion that the second element of paragraph 20(1)(c) has not been met either. I interpret the second element to mean that before interest can be deducted, there must be a legal obligation to pay interest on borrowed money.

[33] According to paragraph 6 of the Amending Agreement, the Appellants had to pay 10% annual interest “subject to” the payment provision in paragraph 6(iii) of that agreement. This provision limited the payment of interest for the years under appeal to minimum annual payments of $20,000[9]. There was no legal obligation to pay interest beyond the $20,000 amounts. There was no legal obligation to pay any portion of the “interest” in 1994, 1995 and 1996.

[34] Counsel for the Appellants argued that there was a legal obligation to pay the “interest” during the relevant years. He stated that if the Appellants had failed to make the entire $20,000 payments during any of the years, then there would be default under the mortgage, and the mortgagee could demand full payment pursuant to section 4 and 10 of the Original Mortgage.

[35] I disagree. According to paragraph 6(iv) of the Amending Agreement, the Appellants could effect an early payout at any time, up to July 31, 2008, by paying the sum of $100,000 plus payment of all 15 minimum $20,00 annual interest payments unpaid at that time. I interpret this to mean that the Appellants did not have to make all of the $20,000 payments on time. As well, paragraph 14 of the Amending Agreement states unequivocally that it takes precedence over the terms in the Original Mortgage.

[36] The Respondent submitted that the amount of “interest” which the Appellants sought to deduct was not reasonable. Counsel for the Appellant objected to this argument on the basis that reasonableness and section 67 had not been pled. However, section 67 did not have to be pled as paragraph 20(1)(c) has its own internal reference to reasonableness[10]. As well, even if reasonableness in the context of these four criteria was not pled, the court could not ignore it, as it constitutes a question of law that must be applied to the particular facts, pursuant to paragraph 20(1)(c).

[37] The Supreme Court of Canada had this to say about the fourth element[11]:

34 The fourth element - that the amount sought to be deducted must be the actual amount paid or "a reasonable amount in respect thereof" - has not previously been the subject of comment by this Court. It is clear, however, from the structure of s. 20(1)(c), that the phrase refers to the entirety of s. 20(1)(c)(i). Therefore, the taxpayer is entitled to deduct the lesser of, (1) the actual amount paid or, (2) a reasonable amount in respect of "an amount paid ... pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on ... borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property". Here, the borrowed money that was used for the purpose of earning income was the NZ$150 million. At trial, Christie A.C.J.T.C. found that the market rate for a loan of NZ$ in 1988 for the five-year term specified in the Debenture Agreements was 15.4 percent per annum. That is the rate Shell paid. Where an interest rate is established in a market of lenders and borrowers acting at arm's length from each other, it is generally a reasonable rate: Mohammad v. R. (1997), 97 D.T.C. 5503 (Fed. C.A.) at p. 5509, per Robertson J.A.; Irving Oil Ltd. v. R., [1991] 1 C.T.C. 350 (Fed. C.A.) at p. 359, per Mahoney J.A. The fourth criterion is accordingly satisfied.

[38] How could the amount of “interest” be “a reasonable amount in respect thereof” when it was not an amount that was paid nor was it an amount that had to be paid in the years under appeal? I conclude that in the circumstances of these appeals, the amount of “interest” was not reasonable.

[39] The Appellants are not allowed to deduct interest in the amounts of $77,186, $80,127 and $84,391 in 1994, 1995 and 1996 respectively.

[40] At the pleading stage of these appeals, the issues were:

a) Whether each of the Appellants was entitled to deduct $100,000 for the Restructuring fee in 1993;

b) Whether each of the Appellants was allowed to claim an interest expense in the amount:

1994 - $77,186

1995 - $80,127

1996 - $84,391

c) Whether there was a settlement or extinguishment of the debt owing under the Original Mortgage in 1993 by virtue of the Settlement Agreement;

d) Whether each Appellant’s proportionate share of the gain on settlement of the Original Mortgage was properly calculated by the Minister;

e) Whether the Minister correctly assessed the Appellants’ 1994 taxation year to reduce the undepreciated capital cost (“UCC”) of the rental properties to nil;

f) Whether, in the alternative, the Minister correctly assessed the Appellants to reduce the UCC of the rental properties to nil on the basis that the Settlement Agreement was a sham;

g) Whether, in the further alternative the Minister correctly assessed the Appellant to reduce the UCC of the rental properties to nil on the basis that the arrangement made to keep the Original Mortgage open for an additional 15 years was an “avoidance transaction” within the meaning of ss. 245(3) of the Act and resulted in a misuse of section 80 and an abuse of the Act read as a whole within the meaning of ss. 245(4) of the Act.

[41] By letter dated prior to the hearing of these appeals, the Respondent conceded all of the issues listed in paragraph 40 except that at b). The appeals are allowed to the extent of the Respondent’s concessions.

[42] The Respondent is entitled to its costs.
