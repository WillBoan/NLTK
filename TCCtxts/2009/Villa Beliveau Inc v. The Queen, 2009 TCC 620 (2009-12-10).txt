REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on Tuesday, December 1, 2009. It follows Judgments of former Justice Alexander A. Sarchuk dated November 1, 2004, which dismissed the appeals from assessments of goods and services tax made under the Excise Tax Act, with costs. Ms. Barbara M. Shields represented the Appellants and Mr. Lyle Bouvier represented the Respondent.

[2] The Bill of Costs submitted by the Respondent is as follows:

1.(1)

1(1)(a)

TOTAL COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS:

[3] Ms. Shields stated that she was taking no position with respect to the Respondent’s Bill of Costs, in that she had no instructions from her clients.

[4] I will therefore allow the full amount claimed on the Bill of Costs. A Certificate in the amount of $196,199.73 will be issued.
