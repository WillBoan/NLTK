START OF REASONS FOR JUDGMENT:

HIS HONOUR: But it's not lost; it's just that you have to pay tax on it. That is what it means: that money is not lost, except that RRSPs are a sort of deferred income, if you’d like; you don't pay tax as long as you qualify for the RRSP amount that you can deposit per year. It's deferred tax, if you'd like.

But I… what you are asking me, I cannot… I have no jurisdiction to do that. You will have to make changes to your tax return and submit it to Revenue Canada. Then, a decision will be issued, and you will appeal that decision. But if those are not the things…

HENRI WITTMANN: So I should redo this one.

HIS HONOUR: No, I'm not even telling you what to do; it's not my… It's not up to me to give you advice. All I'm saying is, if the assessment before me is the way it is described in the Reply to the Notice of Appeal, and you do not object to it, then there is nothing I can do but dismiss your appeal. If you have other submissions to make to Revenue Canada concerning the 2003 taxation year, make them.

HENRI WITTMANN: So I'm starting from scratch.

HIS HONOUR: Well, start from scratch, but if you want to defer that income in some way through accounting, you say that any accountant could do it, so consult one. Then submit it to Revenue Canada, and they will give you a decision or a determination or an assessment. Then, if you don't agree, you will appeal it. And then we might be able to deal with this issue. But at the moment, that's not what is before me. What is before me is an assessment that you do not object to. So, at the moment, I have no jurisdiction to do anything other than process it. But then, you don't object to it, so there is nothing I can do.

So if you think that you can correct this in some other way so that you don't have to pay tax on the portion of expenses that was disallowed, because I imagine that, at first, you thought that all of them were going to be allowed and there wouldn’t be any tax to pay…

HENRI WITTMANN: No, I wouldn't have taken out the RRSPs.

HIS HONOUR: Well, maybe you wouldn’t have taken out the whole amount; you might have left the $16,000 in there, okay.

HENRI WITTMANN: Yes, that's right.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, listen, but if the expenses you claimed are incorrect with respect to the Income Tax Act, well, then they make up a surplus that becomes taxable.

HENRI WITTMANN: Hard to predict.

HIS HONOUR: Well, I understand that, but listen, claiming $15,000 as an expense to begin with… I mean you should have thought about it. Okay. We don't deduct tax as an expense; that would be too much fun. Okay. So I cannot do more than that, Mr. Wittmann.

HENRI WITTMANN: All right.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. The appeal is thus dismissed.
