Respondent.

REASONS FOR ORDER

McArthur J.

[1] This amended motion by the Respondent is for an Order striking the Appellant’s purported appeal on the basis that it is not properly before the Court.

[2] The Appellant’s contention is that the T4s issued to her are in excess of the employment insurance amounts that she actually had. She has advised me that she has an appointment with her Member of Parliament’s assistant who is aware of her position and will attempt to reconcile the amounts in dispute.

[3] I agree with Respondent’s counsel that this Court is not the forum to settle this dispute which cannot be appealed under sections 93 and 103 of the Employment Insurance Act (EIA).

[4] Further, the Appellant has not filed an objection under section 165 of the Income Tax Act (ITA) which is a precondition to appealing to the Tax Court of Canada under section 169 of the ITA.

[5] For these reasons, the purported appeal is quashed.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 3rd day of December 2009.
