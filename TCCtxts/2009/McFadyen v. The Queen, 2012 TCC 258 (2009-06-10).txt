Respondent.

REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] On July 31, 2008, the Respondent was awarded costs in respect of a motion heard on May 8, 2008. On June 3, 2009, the Appellant discontinued his appeal. On July 28, 2011, the Respondent filed a Bill of Costs. My decision on this taxation of costs was made on the basis of the written materials filed by the parties, as follows:

§ Affidavit of Disbursements of Louise Hamelin, sworn July 25, 2011;

§ Letter from counsel for the Appellant dated October 14, 2011, together with the Exhibits thereto;

§ Respondent’s Rebuttal Submissions filed April 13, 2012, consisting of the Affidavit of Louise Hamelin sworn April 13, 2012 and Written Submissions (excluding sub-paragraph 14 (vii)).

[2] The Appellant’s position is that the Respondent is not entitled to recover any amount of costs, as a result of a settlement agreement entered into between the parties, which provided that no costs would be sought by the Respondent.

[3] The Respondent’s position is that there was no binding settlement agreement between the parties and that the Respondent is entitled to recover her costs.

DECISION

[4] As a taxing officer, I have no authority to determine whether the parties have entered into a valid settlement agreement. The validity of a settlement agreement must be judicially determined. In the absence of a judicial determination as to the validity of an agreement between the parties, the Respondent is entitled to have her Bill of Costs taxed.

[5] The Appellant has not challenged any of the amounts claimed for fees and disbursements on the Bill of Costs. The Appellant’s submissions focused on the issue of the validity of the settlement agreement.

[6] The counsel fees claimed on the Bill of Costs are in accordance with Schedule II, Tariff B of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure). The counsel fees claimed are proper and are allowed in full amount of $850.00. The disbursements claimed are reasonable and I am satisfied that they were essential for the conduct of the appeal. The disbursements are allowed in the amount of $292.80.

[7] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and the amount of $1,142.80 is allowed.
