BETWEEN:

BARBARA ALLEN,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR TAXATION

[1] This taxation came on for hearing on Thursday, March 29, 2012, by way of telephone conference call. It followed a Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Campbell dated September 9, 2009, wherein the appeal of an assessment made under the Income Tax Act was dismissed, with costs.

[2] While the Appellant was on the telephone conference call, her husband, Nelson Allen, made submissions on her behalf. Ms. Rishma Bhimji represented the Respondent.

[3] Mr. Allen did not challenge any specific item claimed on the Bill of Costs and stated that he was not sure which items he should challenge. While Mr. Allen made submissions, his comments were not related to the Bill of Costs. His submissions included comments concerning ongoing attempts to enter into a payment agreement with Canada Revenue Agency and to the fact that Mrs. Allen did not have legal representation at the hearing of her appeal.

[4] Ms. Bhimji stated that the amounts claimed on the Bill of Costs were in accordance with the Tariff, were reasonable and should be allowed in full.

[5] I have reviewed the Bill of Costs filed by the Respondent. The counsel fees claimed were in accordance with the Tariff and the disbursements claimed were supported by receipts, copies of which were attached as Exhibits to the Affidavit of Jennifer Graham, filed for use on this taxation. In the absence of any opposition to any of the amounts claimed on the Bill of Costs, I will allow the full amount claimed for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,445.65.

[6] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and $4,445.65 is allowed.
