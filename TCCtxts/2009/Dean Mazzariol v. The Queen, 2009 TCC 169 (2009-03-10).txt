REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Paris, J.

[1] The Appellant is appealing from an assessment dated May 18, 2006 for unremitted GST, and related interest and penalties for the period January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2001.

[2] The Appellant contends that the Minister should have waived the penalties and interest that were imposed because the Appellant made a voluntary disclosure to the Minister in February 2004 that tax was owing. The Minister held that the Appellant was not entitled to a waiver of penalties and interest because the voluntary disclosure was only in respect of tax owing under the Income Tax Act and was not made “for GST purposes.”

[3] It is clear that this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the Minister’s exercise of his discretion under section 281.1 of the Excise Tax Act to waive penalties or interest. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

[4] However, I am satisfied that the Appellant intended the voluntary disclosure made in February 2004 to have been made for the purposes of both the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act, and I would therefore strongly recommend that the Minister exercise his discretion to waive penalties and interest in this case for the periods for which it is open to him to do so.
