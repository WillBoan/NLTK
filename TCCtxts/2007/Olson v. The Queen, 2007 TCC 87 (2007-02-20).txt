REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Beaubier, J.

[1] This appeal pursuant to the General Procedure was heard at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on January 23 and 24 and February 12, 2007. The Appellant is self-represented. He testified in chief on January 23 and 24 and on February 12, 2007. On January 24, he applied to file as Exhibits several assemblies of documents in support of his appeal. The Court reviewed his List of Documents filed with the Court, in which item 2 described the following:

2. Personal Bank/Visa statements, reconciliation 00, 01, 02

The Court then reviewed Rule 84. No Examination for Discovery of the Appellant was undertaken by Respondent's counsel to elicit detail from the Appellant as to what item 2 consisted of. As a result, the Court ruled that the Appellant could file those specific documents (namely, receipts, cheques and reconciliation) which fell within the bounds of the pleadings filed in this appeal. The Notice of Appeal is general. The Reply is detailed; in particular, the only item that the Appellant had not already dealt with related to expenses for his farming operation described in subparagraph 12(e) of the Reply and detailed in Schedule A. Using the 2000 year as an example, the audit allowed $65,558.91 and disallowed $81,047.29. Crown counsel advised that the auditor had given the Appellant a detailed list of the $65,588.91 allowed. Therefore, the Court advised the Appellant that it would allow the Appellant to file documents detailing the $81,047.29 for 2000 and similar farm expense documents for 2001 and 2002. Court was adjourned to February 12, 2007 to allow the Appellant to prepare his documents for evidence in chief for this limited purpose. On February 12, 2007, the Appellant concluded his testimony and Respondent's counsel called the auditor on the file, Robert Berger, C.M.A..

[2] Paragraph 12 of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal details the items in issue. The entire list of the matters in dispute is set out in paragraphs 4 to 12 and in Sections C and D of the Reply. They read:

4. In computing income for the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years, the Appellant reported his taxable income as follows:

2000

2001

2002

2003

21,950.80

21,464.00

39,345.39

37,705.00

5. On June 8, 2004, the Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") reassessed the Appellant for the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years and increased the Appellant's total income by $106,606, $60,976 and $28,522, respectively, calculated as set out in the attached Schedule "A".

b) whether $13,657.35, $23,426.34 and $14,570.07 should be included in the Appellant's income as amounts received or receivable by the Appellant as, on account of, in lieu of payment or in satisfaction of, interest, in the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years respectively;

c) what is the amount of the benefit the Appellant is required to include in his taxable income for the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years with respect to his personal use of the Vans;

d) whether the Appellant is required to include in his income for the 2001 taxation year net rental revenue of $1,330.94; and

e) whether the Appellant is entitled to deduct expenses, including capital cost allowance, in excess of amounts allowed by the Minister in the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years.

C. STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELIED ON

He relies on sections 3, 9, 15 and 166.1, subsections 6(2), 12(1), 18(1), 165(1) and 248(1) and paragraph 6(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the "Act").

D. GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT

1. It is submitted that the Appellant did not file an objection to the Notice of Reassessment dated December 6, 2004 for the 2003 taxation year within the 90 day period specified in subsection 165(1) of the Act. Nor did the Appellant file with the Minister a request for an extension of time to file an objection to the Notice of Reassessment dated December 6, 2004 within the time period specified in section 166.1(7) of the Act. As a result, the Appellant has not satisfied the conditions in subsection 165(1) and section 166.1 of the Act and his Notice of Appeal is not properly before the Court. Accordingly, the Appellant's appeal should be quashed.

2. Further, it is submitted that if the Appellant's appeal is properly before the Court, which is not admitted but is denied, the Minister properly assessed the Appellant's net tax for the 2003 taxation year.

3. It is submitted that the amounts of $13,657.35, $23,426.34 and $14,570.07 were properly included in the Appellant's income in the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years, respectively, pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(c) of the Act since each amount was received or was receivable by the Appellant on account of or in satisfaction of interest.

4. It is submitted that at least 40%, 28% and 39% of the kilometres put on the Vans in the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years, respectively, related to the Appellant's personal use of the 1998 and 2000 Ford vans and were not in connection with or in the course of the Appellant's employment with Shercom.

5. It is submitted that the Appellant's reasonable standby charge in respect of the 1998 and 2000 Ford vans in the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years was correctly calculated in accordance with paragraph 6(1)(e) and subsection 6(2) of the Act.

6. It is submitted that the Appellant failed to report net rental revenue of $1,330.94 in the 2001 taxation year.

7. It is submitted that the Appellant did not incur expenses, including capital cost allowance, of more than $81,047.09, $205,388.84 and $25,303.00 in the 2000, 2001 and 2002 taxation years, respectively, for the purpose of gaining or producing farming income pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act.

8. He requests that the appeal be dismissed with costs.

[3] Assumptions 11(a) to (oo), inclusive, were not refuted by the Appellant in his evidence in chief on January 23 and 24. In particular, he stated that his four children, his wife and he were travelling illegally in a smaller vehicle when Shercom no longer had the vans, implying personal use of the vans. The 1998 van was purchased and owned by Shercom. Both the Appellant's and Shercom's names are on the offer to purchase the 2000 van, but Shercom depreciated 100% of it; therefore, the Court finds that it is Shercom's too. Moreover, Shercom transferred the 2000 van to the Appellant in 2003. The Appellant's evidence did not refute the assumptions in support of issue 12(c). Therefore his appeal relating to these issues is dismissed.

[4] Respecting issue 12(a), the Appellant admitted that he had not filed a Notice of Objection for his 2003 taxation year. Therefore, the purported appeal for that year is quashed.

[5] Respecting issue 12(b), the Appellant stated in his testimony in chief that the interest assessed had been issued to him in respect to shareholder's loans to Shercom on the advice of his accountant. He also claimed that he had loaned large sums of money in each of the years in question to Shercom. But he said that he had not received any money from Shercom. However, the Appellant and Shercom had instituted the interest charges in order to benefit from a loss of opportunity claim in Shercom's legal action against the manufacturer of a defective tire-shredding machine purchased by Shercom for use in its tire recycling business.

[6] Two problems arise in this appeal and they were both caused by the Appellant himself. The first is that he did not distinguish between himself and Shercom in business operations, purchases or anything else. He continued this practice during his testimony, although the Court pointed out the difference and the reasons for it. The second is that in 2000 he was on a cash basis. However, after that he was short of cash so he went on an accrual basis. As a result, at times he did not pay bills and yet deducted them while he continued to receive income. This problem was exacerbated when the Appellant returned to the stand on February 12, 2007 and proposed he claim a deduction for bills that he had paid in 2001 and 2002, but which had already been claimed on the accrual basis.

[7] The Appellant's claims for farm expenses in respect to some items were conceded by Respondent's counsel. The Appellant and the Respondent's auditor went through them in detail on February 12, 2007. The following are allowed as particularized by year and exhibit number:

(1) 2000 - Exhibit A-13 - ALLOWED $414.50 LESS GST

- Princess Auto Nov 13, as above, allowed $414.50 less GST.

- In particular, his claim for an office in the home is new and is not sufficiently particularized to be allowed.

(2) 2001 - Exhibit A-14 - ALLOWED $9,151.05

- Paragraph 9g, allowed, as above, by consent $9,151.05.

- He also claimed a further $1,500 rent paid. However, one $1,500 claim was allowed and without full documentation distinguishing these two, his second claim is not allowed.

- Two other Agri condo claims of $1,126.28 and $1,148.31 were also put forward by the Appellant. However, without the documents and clear proof by the Appellant that they have not already been allowed, they are denied.

- The Appellant's claim to deduct $1,728 insurance fee on a 1992 Freightliner in order that Shercom could use it to haul tires is denied. He testified that he and Shercom each owned an interest in it; Mr. Olson, for farm use, for which he had paid a lower insurance premium and Shercom, for commercial use. He stated that the $1,728 was the extra insurance premium so that Shercom could use it, therefore it is a Shercom expense.

- "interest to Ruud" $3,600 - this claim has no documentary support at all. The Appellant alleges that he paid interest to Mr. Ruud, who purchased two ¼ sections of farmland for him. Mr. Ruud is a relative, therefore without suitable documentation this claim is denied.

- Finally, he claimed two Princess Auto amounts of $620.59 and $1,615.97. Both of these were already claimed by Shercom.

(3) 2002 - Exhibit A-16

- Canada Revenue Agency disallowed $7,098. The auditor testified that this consisted of two Freightliner payments of $3,459.03 each. They were denied to the Appellant because he had no farm revenue in 2002. He had quit farming. The Appellant did not give any detailed evidence as to dates of leaving farming, equipment, grain sales or any detail of income amounts. As a result, this claim fails. He has not satisfied the onus of proof on him.

[8] As a result, the appeal is allowed in respect to issue 12(e) only as to those items detailed in paragraph [7] hereof.

[9] The Appellant's evidence did not refute the assumptions in support of issue 12(d). As a result, the appeal respecting this issue is denied.

[10] The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment pursuant to the particulars contained in paragraphs [7] and [8] hereof.

[11] The Respondent is awarded party and party costs on account of this appeal.
