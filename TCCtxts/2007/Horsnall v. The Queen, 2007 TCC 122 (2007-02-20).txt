REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Beaubier, J.

[1] This matter was appealed from my Judgment dated 6 September, 2005. The Federal Court of Appeal, by its Judgment from the Bench on November 20, 2006 referred the matter back to this Court "for a determination of the Appellant's liabilities for the penalties in view of the due diligence defence."

[2] Section 280 of the Excise Tax Act as it was during the period in appeal (January 1, 1998 to September 30, 2001) imposed a penalty for which a defence of due diligence lay.

[3] The evidence for the Appellant established at questions 5, 38 and 164 that the Appellant spoke to GST officials and dealt with the GST filings the way that they instructed him to. That evidence was not refuted in any way.

[4] For these reasons, the Appellant's appeal respecting the penalties levied in this matter is granted.

[5] This matter is remitted to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment to vacate the penalties so imposed.

Signed at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan this 27th day of February 2007.
