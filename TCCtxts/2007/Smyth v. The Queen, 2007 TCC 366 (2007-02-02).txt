01 (PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED AT 12:54 P.M.)

02 THE REGISTRAR: Order, all rise.

03 The Court will now

04 render a decision in Appeal

05 Number 2005-4329(IT)I between James R. Smyth,

06 the appellant, and Her Majesty the Queen, the

07 respondent.

08 JUSTICE PARIS: Thank you. Please be

09 seated.

10 This is an appeal from a

11 reassessment of the appellant's 2001 and 2002

12 taxation years by which the Minister of

13 National Revenue disallowed his claim for the

14 overseas employment tax credit. The appellant

15 claimed an overseas employment tax credit of

16 $11,153 in 2001, and $38,448 in 2002 in respect

17 of his employment income earned in Kosovo where

18 he provided police services within the context

19 of the United Nations Mission there.

20 The issues in this

21 appeal are whether the appellant qualifies

22 under

23 Section 122.3 of the Income Tax Act for an OETC

24 in these years, and if not, whether any

25 deduction is available to him under

0005

01 paragraph 110(1)(f) of the Act.

02 The facts relied upon by

03 the Minister in reassessing the appellant are

04 set out in paragraph 10 of the amended

05 reply to notice of appeal and will form part of

06 these reasons. (annexed as schedule 1)

07 The respondent has

08 indicated in the amended reply that the

09 appellant provided police services in Kosovo

10 rather than Bosnia Herzegovina as originally

11 assumed. This was born out by the evidence,

12 and nothing turns on this minor error in the

13 assumptions.

14 Section 122.3 sets out

15 several conditions that must be met in order

16 for a taxpayer to qualify for the tax credit.

17 The relevant parts of Section 122.3(1)

18 read as follows:

19 If an individual is resident in

20 Canada in a taxation year and,

21 throughout any period or more than 6

22 consecutive months that began before

23 the end of the year and included any

24 part of the year...

25 (a) was employed by a person who was a

0006

01 specified employer, other than for the

02 performance of services under a

03 prescribed international development

04 assistance program of the Government

05 of Canada, and

06 (b) performed all or substantially all

07 the duties of the individual's

08 employment outside Canada

09 (i) in connection with a contract

10 under which the specified employer

11 carried on business outside Canada

12 with respect to...

13 (C) any prescribed activity, or

14 (ii) for the purpose of obtaining, on

15 behalf of the specified employer, a

16 contract to undertake any of the

17 activities referred to {above}..."

18 Section 122.3 then sets out the

19 method of calculating the OETC.

20 The first question that

21 must be decided is by whom the appellant was

22 employed while working in Kosovo. The

23 appellant argues that he was employed by the UN

24 in Kosovo and that his employment relationship

25 with the Edmonton Police Service was severed

0007

01 prior to his commencing work in Kosovo.

02 He referred to the

03 evidence of two witnesses from the Edmonton

04 Police Service who had participated in the same

05 UN Mission in Kosovo, as well as to his own

06 evidence that the work done there was outside

07 the collective agreement between the Edmonton

08 Police Service and Edmonton Police Association

09 and that, in particular, the terms of the

10 collective agreement relating to working hours

11 and working conditions were not adhered to.

12 The appellant also

13 referred to a document, Exhibit A-4, entitled

14 "Certification of Employment," issued by the

15 assistant director of administration, UN

16 Mission in Kosovo Police, that certified that

17 the appellant was employed as a civilian police

18 officer by the UN Mission in Kosovo. It also

19 stated the appellant was compensated at a rate

20 of $71 US a day while employed with the UN

21 Mission in Kosovo Police.

22 I cannot agree with the

23 appellant's arguments on this point. The

24 evidence of Sergeant Glen Hayden of the

25 Edmonton Police Service, who was a member of

0008

01 the Edmonton Police Association executive, was

02 that the appellant did not cease to be a member

03 of either the Edmonton Police Service or the

04 Edmonton Police Association while with the

05 UN Mission.

06 The documentary evidence

07 shows the appellant received his regular salary

08 from the Edmonton Police Service and was

09 entitled to certain benefits provided in the

10 collective agreement. Those benefits included

11 credit for calculating his seniority and

12 pension in respect of time worked in Kosovo and

13 coverage under medical and dental plans.

14 I can see nothing in the

15 documentation to suggest that the appellant's

16 employment with the Edmonton Police Service was

17 severed at any point in the years in issue. It

18 appears, rather, the appellant was permitted

19 within the course of his employment to

20 participate in the Kosovo Mission under the

21 conditions set out in Exhibit R-1, the letter

22 of agreement between the Edmonton Police

23 Service, the RCMP, and the appellant and his

24 coworker, Constable Stolarchuk.

25 The fact that the

0009

01 Edmonton Police Service was a signatory to that

02 agreement is indicative of the ongoing

03 relationship between the individual

04 participants and the EPS. And in particular, I

05 refer to paragraph 2.1 and 2.2 of the agreement

06 by which the Edmonton Police Service agrees to

07 provide the participants as part of the

08 UN Mission and to make them available for the

09 Mission.

10 The Edmonton Police

11 Service also retained control over the

12 participants in the event that they failed to

13 comply with the UN operational guidelines for

14 the UN Police Force.

15 The fact that the

16 Edmonton Police Service was reimbursed the cost

17 of the participant's salary and benefits by the

19 RCMP does not alter the pre-existing employment

20 relationship, and I note that the agreement

21 also provided that the participants would not

22 be considered employees of the RCMP.

23 With respect to the

24 certification of employment issued by the

25 United Nations Mission in Kosovo, Exhibit A-4,

0010

01 there is no evidence as to the basis on which

02 the certification was made. The document does

03 not purport to be a contract of employment, and

04 no contract between the appellant and the UN

05 was produced at the hearing.

06 To the extent that

07 Exhibit A-4 contradicts the arrangements made

08 by the Edmonton Police Service, the RCMP, and

09 the appellant himself regarding the his

10 participation in the mission as set out in the

11 letter agreement, I would attach little weight

12 to it. It appears to have been prepared for

13 limited purpose and cannot be taken to

14 displace the letter agreement without the

15 express consent of all of the parties to the

16 letter agreement.

17 The appellant may have

18 taken on duties and responsibilities outside of

19 those of a normal police officer working in

20 Edmonton, but this was by agreement between

21 Edmonton Police Service and the appellant.

22 Similarly, the appellant agreed to perform the

23 work according to the conditions set out in the

24 UN guidelines.

25 There is nothing before

0011

01 me to show that the appellant was prevented

02 from agreeing to these terms and conditions

03 while continuing his employment with the

04 Edmonton Police Service. Therefore, I find

05 that the appellant was in fact employed by the

06 Edmonton Police Service while performing his

07 duties in Kosovo.

08 The next matter to be

09 decided is whether the work performed by the

10 appellant in Kosovo was performed in connection

11 with a contract under which the Edmonton Police

12 Service carried on business outside Canada as

13 required by Subsection 122.3(1) of the act.

14 The appellant argues

15 that it is sufficient for the Edmonton Police

16 Service to provide services in connection with

17 a contract under which the RCMP carried on

18 business outside Canada. He relies in this

19 respect on the decision of this Court in

20 Gonsalves v. The Queen, 2000 DTC 1491.

21 The difficulty with this

22 position is that in order for either the

23 Edmonton Police Service or the RCMP to be found

24 to be carrying on business, there would need to

25 be evidence that they were undertaking the

0012

01 policing activities in Kosovo for profit. This

02 requirement flows from the Federal Court of

03 Appeal decisions in Dansereau v. The Queen, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1560

04 and Timmins v. The Queen, [1999] 2 F.C. No. 563. This profit must

05 be a pecuniary profit and not a notional

06 benefit as suggested by the appellant.

07 There is nothing to

08 suggest that the Edmonton Police Service or the

09 RCMP participated in the policing activity in

10 Kosovo for a pecuniary or financial profit.

11 Therefore, the appellant's work in Kosovo does

12 not meet the conditions set out in

13 subparagraph 122.3(1)(b)(i) of the Act.

14 Furthermore, there is no

15 evidence to show that the policing work in

16 Kosovo was a prescribed activity within the

17 meaning of sub subparagraph 122.3(1)(b)(ii)(c),

18 which requires that the work be performed in

19 connection with a contract with United Nations.

20 I cannot accept the appellant's suggestion that

21 the documents entered in evidence are

22 sufficient to show such a contract existed.

23 The basis and terms on

24 which the Canadian police officers were made

25 available to the UN has not been shown, and it

0013

01 is not open for me to speculate as to the

02 nature of those agreements.

03 For these reasons, I

04 find that the appellant's employment in Kosovo

05 does not meet the conditions set out in

06 subparagraph 122.3(1)(b)(i) of the Act, and he

07 is not entitled to the OETC for 2001 and 2002.

08 While the appellant did

09 not present any arguments to support a claim

10 for deduction under paragraph 110(1)(f) of the

11 Act, he did raise the matter in his Notice of

12 Appeal, and counsel for the respondent

13 addressed the point.

14 I agree with the

15 respondent that no deduction under that

16 provision is available. I have already found that the

17 appellant was employed by the Edmonton Police

18 Service during the relevant period, and

19 therefore, his income from employment does not

20 fall within 110(1)(f)(iii), which is income

21 from employment with a prescribed international

22 organization. Furthermore,

25 subparagraph 110(1)(f)(v) was not added to the

0014

01 Act until 2005 and is only applicable to

02 taxation years after 2003.

03 The appellant also

04 challenges the interest and penalties assessed

05 by the Minister in this case. The appellant

06 points out that he claimed the credit on the

07 advice of his employer and, in particular, upon

08 the advice of Daniel Jones who heads the

09 international peacekeeping policing program at

10 the Edmonton Police Service.

11 Jones also was one of

12 the first members of the Edmonton Police

13 Service to serve in Kosovo. Jones gave

14 evidence that he made inquiries at the Edmonton

15 CRA office as to whether he was entitled to the

16 overseas employment tax credit for income he

17 earned while working in Kosovo under the same

18 program as the appellant later worked and was

19 told he qualified.

20 Jones, on behalf of the

21 Edmonton Police Service, subsequently advised

22 other participants that they were able to claim

23 the credit. Evidence was also given by

24 Constable Stolarchuk that there was a great

25 deal of confusion at the CRA over her claim for

0015

01 the OETC which was initially disallowed, then

02 allowed, and finally disallowed again.

03 There is ample

04 jurisprudence to the effect that the Minister

05 is not bound by the representations of his

06 employees, and the Court does not have the

07 jurisdiction to order that penalties and

08 interest be reduced except where the act --

09 where the appellant has shown that those

10 amounts were not calculated and imposed in

11 accordance with the provisions of the

12 Act.

13 The appellant did not submit

14 that the penalties and

15 interest were not in accordance with the Act

16 but suggested that, as a matter of

17 equity, they should be deleted. Unfortunately,

18 I do not have the power to do that. I can,

19 however, express my opinion that this would be

20 an appropriate case for the waiver of penalty

21 and interest under the provisions of the

22 fairness package for the period preceding the

23 reassessment, given that the appellant's claim

24 for the overseas employment tax credit was

25 based on erroneous advice provided by the CRA.

0016

01 For all these reasons,

02 the appeal is dismissed. Thank you.

03 MR. SMYTH: Thank you, Your Honour.

04 THE REGISTRAR: This case is now closed.

05 Court will resume at

06 two o'clock this afternoon.

(f) the Appellant did not receive any other employment income in the 2001 and 2002 years, other than the amounts received from the EPS;

(g) the Appellant claimed the OETC based on employment income earned while in Bosnia-Herzegovina of $11,153.00 in 2001 and $38,448.00 in 2002;

(i) the EPS did not have a contract with the United

Nations.
