0004

04 JUSTICE RIP: Okay. It's your turn.

05 MR. DRAKE: I guess when you go on

06 these jobs, you're always expecting for a

07 long-term employment --

08 JUSTICE RIP: Beg your pardon?

09 MR. DRAKE: You're always expected

10 to have a long-term employment, good terms with

11 the company, and maybe work for that company.

12 So whenever I go to these jobs, sometimes they

13 only end up being --

14 JUSTICE RIP: When have you had a

15 long-term employment for about a couple of

16 years?

17 MR. DRAKE: Like, recently? Yeah,

18 just --

19 JUSTICE RIP: In 2001, 2000.

20 MR. DRAKE: The long-term is --

21 JUSTICE RIP: No. 2001, 2002, did you

22 have any long-term employment.

23 MR. DRAKE: 2001 I started the

24 Boston long-term employment.

25 JUSTICE RIP: Beg your pardon?

0005

01 MR. DRAKE: The Boston, that was

02 my --

03 JUSTICE RIP: What was it? How long

04 was it?

05 MR. DRAKE: Ten months, but it could

06 have been longer, but the visas couldn't be

07 issued.

08 JUSTICE RIP: Now, Boston. And where

09 were you going, from Boston to where?

10 MR. DRAKE: Well, I got laid off,

11 and that's when I went to Bechtel.

12 JUSTICE RIP: That's where -- the

13 government's consenting to the Boston.

14 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

15 JUSTICE RIP: They're consenting to

16 that.

17 MR. DRAKE: Oh, yeah. I'm just

18 saying that -- she's saying that I've never

19 permanently had a --

20 JUSTICE RIP: Well, you need a

21 residency; you've got to acquire a residence.

22 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

23 JUSTICE RIP: When I say "acquire,"

24 you don't have to buy, but you have to live --

25 you have to set up a residence.

0006

01 MR. DRAKE: Yeah, well, that would

02 be the next step, but then when you get laid

03 off, you don't have a choice.

04 JUSTICE RIP: That's the problem.

05 MR. DRAKE: That's the problem. But

06 what do you do, right? You know, I'm just

07 saying that if I -- you know, I'm claiming --

08 for me, if I'm claiming 35 cents a kilometre,

09 you know, gas is taxed probably at 35 cents a

10 kilometre, you're not losing out; I'm bringing

11 in new income into the country, and I'm being

12 penalized.

13 JUSTICE RIP: What does the act --

14 find me somewhere in the Income Tax Act that I

15 can allow it to you.

16 MR. DRAKE: The moving expense?

17 JUSTICE RIP: Anything.

18 MR. DRAKE: Just I know moving

19 expenses, I'm allowed to move from -- like she

20 said, it says in there you can't go from Canada

21 to the US, but I can do moving expenses

22 within -- a move within one country, like, in

23 the same -- a move from, like, say, Boston and

24 New York would be considered allowable.

25 Anything going -- if I was going to Fluor --

0007

01 when I was laid off at Ohio and I worked for a

02 Canadian company, well, I should be allowed

03 that move.

04 JUSTICE RIP: You should be, but

05 you're not.

06 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

07 JUSTICE RIP: The act doesn't permit

08 you to. You have to show me that the act

09 permits it. Not what should be --

10 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

11 JUSTICE RIP: -- but what actually is.

12 I've got to follow the laws, not -- what the

13 law is is not necessarily fair --

14 MR. DRAKE: Yeah. Yeah.

15 JUSTICE RIP: -- or not necessarily in

16 common sense.

17 MR. DRAKE: Well, when I phoned the

18 revenue agencies, they're like, As long as

19 it's -- that's what I do, right? I do what

20 they say, right?

21 JUSTICE RIP: Well, maybe you

22 shouldn't be doing that.

23 MR. DRAKE: Yeah, well, they

24 shouldn't be doing that, but . . .

25 Also for my expenses, if

0008

01 I work for Fluor Canada and I get a job test

02 there and I worked for -- in Edmonton, like

03 Boilermakers is in Edmonton, I reported there,

04 I just had a T2200. As a company they filled

05 it out.

06 JUSTICE RIP: The thing is, we're not

07 concerned with that.

08 MR. DRAKE: Yeah. I just pretty

09 much just gave you the information what I feel

10 like --

11 JUSTICE RIP: Beg your pardon?

12 MR. DRAKE: Just the information

13 that I provided with my moving expenses and

14 employment expenses, it's your decision.

15 JUSTICE RIP: The problem is, sir, is

16 they're not eligible expenses. An employee --

17 first of all, to deduct an employee expense,

18 you have to be an employee. And you did not

19 become an employee of these companies until you

20 are on the site. Is that not true?

21 MR. DRAKE: Yes, that's true.

22 JUSTICE RIP: So the expenses getting

23 there, they're lost. They're somewhere in

24 cyberspace, so to speak. They're nothings.

25 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

0009

01 JUSTICE RIP: So they're not deducted.

02 It's a problem. I feel for you. I feel for

03 you because if you -- if there was evidence

04 that, you know, and there isn't any, and I

05 don't know how you would prove this, if you are

06 an independent contractor, a person carrying on

07 his own business is entitled to expenses that

08 an employee is not. Whether it's fair or not,

09 I'm not here to rule. But if you carry on a

10 business on your own, you're allowed certain

11 expenses that an employee's not.

12 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

13 JUSTICE RIP: But I can't help that.

14 MR. DRAKE: I just think if you're

15 moving to earn an income or start a new job --

16 JUSTICE RIP: But that is not -- it's

17 a difference. Employment income is not an

18 expense, is not -- it's -- you're restricted.

19 The act states specifically, living expense as

20 an employee, no way. It's Section 6.

21 MR. DRAKE: Mm-hmm. Just because I

22 didn't hold the residence long enough --

23 JUSTICE RIP: Never mind residence. I

24 didn't go into -- I questioned you on it, Did

25 you set up a residence? The answer is --

0010

01 except in Boston, the answer is no.

02 MR. DRAKE: Yeah, well, it takes a

03 little bit of time to set up a residence when

04 you're --

05 JUSTICE RIP: But you have to do it.

06 That's what the law says.

07 MR. DRAKE: Well, people get their

08 mail sent to hotels, people in Canada that live

09 in motels, and that's their residency.

10 JUSTICE RIP: They are living in

11 hotels when they may have a residence somewhere

12 else.

13 MR. DRAKE: They get their mail sent

14 there, and you know, if someone's been living

15 in a motel in Canada for the last five years,

16 where do you consider them a resident? People

17 sitting in camps up there, they've been up

18 there for probably five or six years, or some

19 have been up for 10, 15, 20 years, 30 years,

20 and that's a residence. How do you tax the

21 person.

22 JUSTICE RIP: That may be their

23 residence, but when you are in a hotel on a

24 short-term basis, that's not your residence.

25 MR. DRAKE: But the 15 days for --

0011

01 JUSTICE RIP: But that's if you set

02 up -- assuming you set up a residence when

03 you're going to a residence. So if you don't

04 set up the residence, you don't get this moving

05 expense.

06 MR. DRAKE: So if you set up the

07 residence, just -- you know, it's just after

08 the fact. You know, whatever happens after the

09 15 days it shouldn't matter if --

10 JUSTICE RIP: It does matter. Quite

11 so. It's very important.

12 MR. DRAKE: Yeah, but how does that

13 benefit the system?

14 JUSTICE RIP: Because you are in the

15 hotel because a residence may not be ready, may

16 not be available.

17 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

18 Well, it's your

19 decision. Whatever. If I . . .

20 (EXCERPT ENDS)

0012

01 JUSTICE RIP: Okay. What I'm going to

02 do, sir, I'm going to give you what the Crown

03 consented to. I'm going to give you an --

04 the -- I'm going to have to -- as I say, I

05 don't want to repeat myself again. But I think

06 you understand we've gone through the appeal

07 during the trial; we've gone through the --

08 the -- the RRSP and the pension. I think you

09 understand why you're not -- that's not

10 available to you, because you had a contingent

11 right in those years.

12 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

13 JUSTICE RIP: Okay. Then -- and I

14 told you -- and I told you to get in touch with

15 your minister of finance, your member of

16 parliament to try to get -- maybe they can give

17 you permission regarding to this.

18 MR. DRAKE: Yeah, I'll -- I'll --

19 JUSTICE RIP: So do that. With

20 respect to the moving expenses, you may even

21 want to try that. Say, Look, in my situation,

22 I'm falling through the cracks. And you may

23 want to even discuss that with them at your --

24 that you're going to various employment sites

25 across North America, and you can't deduct it

0013

01 even. You may want to discuss that as well.

02 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

03 JUSTICE RIP: Because as I said to

04 you, and I just want to repeat to you, that's

05 wholly discretionary to the Minister or to the

06 government, and they may or may not allow you

07 or give you the -- the remission. Okay?

08 So I'm going to allow

09 you a deduction. And what year is that?

10 That's in 2001, I understand, is that correct,

11 the deduction, the Boston to New York via

12 Newfoundland?

13 MS. CHARLTON: I believe that's 2002.

14 JUSTICE RIP: 2002.

15 Now, the other thing I

16 want to bring out, in paragraph 9 of the reply,

17 that -- that has been assessment establishing

18 the increase in the union fees; is that

19 correct? It's not something the Minister's

20 conceding that hasn't been assessed?

21 MS. CHARLTON: I apologize.

22 JUSTICE RIP: Beg your pardon?

23 Because it's not clear, to be quite honest with

24 you. It says -- okay, it says the Minister

25 increased the deduction. Okay.

0014

01 MS. CHARLTON: The Minister allowed the

02 $3,787 that he asked for.

03 JUSTICE RIP: Okay. So I don't have

04 to worry about that.

05 So for 2002 there'll be

06 a deduction of 2,193.17 with respect to moving

07 expenses.

08 And I want you -- you

09 know, what's important, Mr. Drake, is the

10 comments here of Chief Justice Bowman. Are --

11 he's usually very sympathetic to taxpayers, as

12 I hope to be. And in Jenner, in which he

13 explained at the end -- and this Jenner is not

14 all together different than you, going into

15 various areas.

16 And Justice Bowman says

17 (quoted as read):

18 "Mr. Jenner seeks to import into

19 section 8 deductions that are

20 analogous to the allowances that are

21 specifically excluded by

22 subsection 6(6). While such arguments

23 by analogy may be philosophically

24 attractive they do not fit within the

25 accepted rules of statutory

0015

01 interpretation employed in construing

02 the Income Tax Act. The taxation of

03 employment income as well as the

04 deduction of amounts spent in earning

05 that income is spelt out in the Income

06 Tax Act with great specificity. The

07 cost of travel from Mr. Jenner's home

08 in Sturgeon Falls to the various

09 places where he was employed

10 by...different employers as well as

11 his living expenses when he was

12 working at those work sites is simply

13 not covered by section 8 of the Income

14 Tax Act, even though in the broad

15 sense one might say that the expenses

16 were related to his employment."

17 You've found the same

18 trap as he has. I'm using a "trap" not in any

19 way, I'm just saying that it's an unfortunate

20 situation he found himself in and you found

21 yourself in.

22 MR. DRAKE: Yeah.

23 JUSTICE RIP: And what I would like to

24 add to your expenses, I don't think I can. So

25 I will dismiss 2001, and I will allow 2002 to

0016

01 meet your deduction of 2,193.17.

02 MR. DRAKE: That was for the moving

03 expense.

04 JUSTICE RIP: For the moving

05 expense.

06 MR. DRAKE: And that was

07 two-thousand . . .

08 JUSTICE RIP: 193.17.

09 Other than that, I have

10 a problem. I don't think I can --

11 MR. DRAKE: Yeah, well, that's --

12 that's -- that will be all right. That's the

13 first step, and then my RRSPs, you know, if it

14 works out.

15 JUSTICE RIP: There's no guarantee.

16 MR. DRAKE: No, but it's the second

17 step, right?

18 JUSTICE RIP: Beg your pardon?

19 MR. DRAKE: It's a second step.

20 JUSTICE RIP: It's a kick at the can.

21 MR. DRAKE: I found a few other

22 things to -- I didn't bring up.

23 JUSTICE RIP: Thank you very much.

24 Sorry if I kept you.

25 THE REGISTRAR: Order. All rise.

0017

01 The hearing is now

02 concluded. The court is now closed for the day
