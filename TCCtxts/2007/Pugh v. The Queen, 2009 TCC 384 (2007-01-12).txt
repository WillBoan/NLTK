REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on July 30, 2009. It follows a Judgment by former Justice Louise Lamarre Proulx dated January 19, 2007, wherein the appeal from an assessment made under the Income Tax Act for the 2000 taxation year was dismissed, with costs.

[2] At the time appointed for the hearing of this taxation of costs, an unsuccessful attempt to contact the Appellant was made. In accordance with Rule 13 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), the Appellant was contacted thirty minutes thereafter, at which time he requested an adjournment of this hearing. The Appellant’s request for an adjournment was denied.

[3] The Appellant chose not to participate in this hearing. Ms. Stéphanie Côté represented the Respondent.
