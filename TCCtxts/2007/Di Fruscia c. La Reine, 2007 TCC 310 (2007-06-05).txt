REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Rip A.C.J.

[1] Carmine Di Fruscia appeals from an income tax assessment for 1999 in which the Minister of National Revenue ("Minister") denied his claim for a capital gain of $10,000 on the disposition of a building on Jean Talon Est in Montreal. The Minister assessed on the basis that the appellant's capital gain on the disposition was $42,480.

[2] The building had been used as a garage. It was built in the early 1960s and required substantial renovations when acquired by the appellant.

[3] The appellant and another person purchased the property for $235,000 in 1995. While the purchase price was $235,000, the City of Montreal valued the property at about $450,000, according to Mr. Di Fruscia. He stated the building was in a bad state and that was the reason for the lower price. He calculated his capital gain by adding $35,000 of "capital expenditures" to the cost and deducted the $270,000 from his proceeds of sale, $280,000. The Minister, on reassessing, allowed only $513 as capital expenses and increased the capital gain to $44,487. At the objection stage, the Minister allowed an additional amount of $2,007 to capital cost and reduced the capital gain to $42,480.

[4] The dispute between the parties is whether, prior to disposition, the appellant incurred expenses on account of income or capital.

[5] The expenditures in issue are the following:

Replacement of a furnace and burner

$ 2,911.72

Garage floor repairs

$ 3,304.70

Replace brick on exterior wall of building

$19,324.00

Transfer tax on purchase of building

$ 6,087.00

Notary expenses

not known

[6] The expenditure of $6,087 was a "transfer fee", a tax payable by the purchaser of a building when title is transferred. This is surely a capital expenditure. Respondent's counsel conceded this in argument.

[7] My colleague Lamarre Proulx J. reviewed in depth the distinction between capital and current expenses when a building is being renovated: Bergeron et al. c. M.R.N.[1]

[8] In M.N.R. v. Vancouver Tug Boat Company Limited,[2] the Exchequer Court held that the replacements of a boat engine and of the engine for a power shovel were capital expenditures. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the acquisition of stoves and refrigerators were not repairs but replacements and thus capital outlays: M.N.R. v. Haddon Hall Realty Inc.[3] At the case at bar, the purchase of a new furnace was also the purchase of a capital asset. The new furnace replaced the old furnace, but without a new furnace the use and enjoyment of the building would be affected. A new asset was acquired.

[9] The repair of a floor is a current expense. There is no addition of an asset. An old asset, because of its use, has been repaired.[4] Similarly, the replacement of bricks to the exterior wall of a building is a repair. No wall is being replaced. Old, damaged brick has been replaced by new bricks to make the building suitable for normal use.[5]

[10] Unfortunately, there is no evidence as to what fees were charged by the notary on the appellant's acquisition of the property. The appellant estimates notarial fees to have been between $2,000 and $3,000. An amount, no doubt, was charged and such an amount would be a capital expense. There is no doubt that notarial fees were paid and I am inclined to allow notarial fees of $1,000 as a capital expenditure.

[11] I shall therefore allow the appeal and refer the matter back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment to add the amounts of $6,087.00, $2,911.72 and $1,000.00, that is, $9,998.72, to the capital cost of the property. The appellant shall not be entitled to costs.
