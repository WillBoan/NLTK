REASONS FOR ORDER

McArthur J.

[1] This motion is for an order quashing the Appellant’s appeal for the 2004 taxation year on the basis the reassessment objected to and appealed by the Appellant is a nil assessment. There is a well established rule that there can be no appeal from a nil assessment[1]. The Appellant’s position does not fall within the exception to the general rule as set out by Bowman C.J. in Aallcann Wood Suppliers Inc. v. The Queen. [2]

[2] The Appellant represented himself and he stated that the amount of tax was being demanded from him so it could not be a nil assessment. The relevant Notice of Reassessment indicates:

Amount of previous assessment

Revised amount

Net federal tax

$501.30

0.00

Net Ontario tax

$1,084.90

1,586.20

[3] It is understandably very confusing for the Appellant, but the amount with which he is concerned is Ontario tax over which this Court does not have jurisdiction. I believe the Appellant’s recourse is before the Ontario Superior Court if he is within statutory time limits.

[4] In conclusion, the motion is granted. The Notice of Appeal for the 2004 taxation year is quashed since the Notice of Reassessment resulted in nil federal tax owing.
