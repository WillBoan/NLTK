Respondent.

REASONS FOR ORDER

O'Connor, J.

[1] This Notice of Motion to dismiss the appeal was originally filed by the Respondent on April 24, 2006. This Court by letter dated June 2, 2006 notified the Appellant and the Respondent that the said Motion would be heard on Monday August 14, 2006 at 9:30 a.m. The Respondent on August 4, 2006 filed an Amended Notice of Motion but at the hearing on August 14, 2006, at which the Appellant was present, the Respondent withdrew the Amended Notice of Motion, presumably because the Appellant was not advised of it or of its hearing date.

[2] Therefore I am concerned only with the original Notice of Motion filed April 24, 2006 ("Motion to Dismiss") which is supported by an Affidavit of Marie-Eve Aubry dated April 21, 2006 filed originally with the Court on April 24, 2006.

[3] The Motion to Dismiss was filed under Sections 64 and 65 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules ("General Procedure"). It is a Motion for an Order:

1. dismissing the appeal, ...

2. granting such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.

The whole with costs payable to the Respondent forthwith in any event of the cause.

[4] The grounds for the Motion to Dismiss are as follows:

1. that the Respondent is not in default under the Rules;

2. that the Appellant failed to provide the Respondent with the particulars requested;

3. that the Appellant failed to comply with the Order from this Court of Mr. Justice T. O'Connor, dated December 6, 2005, ordering him to provide the Respondent with all particulars requested within thirty days of the said Order;

4. that the Appellant failed to prosecute his appeal with due dispatch.

[5] The chronology of the facts leading up to the Motion to Dismiss are best set forth in the following extracts from the Affidavit of Marie-Eve Aubry in support of the Motion to Dismiss dated April 21, 2006 and a further Affidavit of Marie-Eve Aubry dated November 23, 2005 filed in support of the Motion for particulars.

2. On February 15, 2005, Mr. Gatien Fournier ("Mr. Fournier"), counsel for the Respondent, sent to the Appellant, by priority post, a Demand for Particulars, with respect to some allegations found in the Notice of Appeal, pursuant to section 52 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and a draft consent to an extension of time to file the Reply. ...

3. In the Demand for Particulars ..., Mr. Fournier requested that the particulars be supplied within thirty days from the date of the Demand.

4. The Appellant received the Demand for Particulars and the draft consent on February 21, 2005. ...

11. On April 4, 2006, the Appellant sent a letter in response to the Respondent's letter dated March 13, 2006. A copy of the said letter is attached as Exhibit "I" to my Affidavit.

12. On April 6, 2006, I sent a letter to the Appellant requesting that the remaining particulars be sent to the Respondent on or before April 20, 2006 before 4:00 p.m. A copy of the said letter is attached as Exhibit "J" to my Affidavit.

13. I am informed by Mr. Fournier that, as of today [April 21, 2006], the Respondent has not received any other information or particulars from the Appellant.

None of the allegations in the said Affidavits have been denied or proven false.

[6] The particulars requested in the Motion for Particulars which are still missing are the following.

A. The Notice of Appeal states in paragraphs 2 and 8 as follows:

2. The Appellant is a beneficiary of the Simcoe Deed and other Treaties associated with MBQ.

...

8. Pursuant to the Simcoe Deed and any other Treaties associated with MBQ, the Appellant is not required to: (1) apply for a GST number, or (2) collect and remit GST in relation to business transactions on the territory of MBQ. The Treaty rights are recognized and confirmed by sec. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.

[7] The Simcoe Deed has been supplied by the Appellant so that the particulars that have not been supplied in this respect are: what are the other Treaties associated with MBQ (Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte) which establish that the Appellant is a beneficiary of the other Treaties associated with MBQ and what are the other Treaties associated with MBQ which establish that the Appellant is not required to: (1) apply for a GST number, or (2) collect and remit GST in relation to business transactions on the territory of MBQ.

B. The Notice of Appeal states in paragraphs 3 and 9 as follows:

3. The Appellant is a beneficiary of Aboriginal rights associated with MBQ.

...

9. Pursuant to the Aboriginal rights associated with MBQ, the Appellant is not required to: (1) apply for a GST number, or (2) collect and remit GST in relation to business transactions on the territory of MBQ. The Aboriginal rights are recognized and confirmed by sec. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.

[8] In this regard the particulars that have not been supplied are: how is the Appellant a beneficiary of Aboriginal rights associated with MBQ and how do those original rights associated with MBQ establish that the Appellant is not required to (1) apply for a GST number, or (2) collect and remit GST in relation to business transactions on the territory of MBQ.

C. The Notice of Appeal states in paragraphs 6 and 12 as follows:

6. The policies of CCRA exempt First Nation citizens from GST in certain circumstances.

12. Pursuant to the policies of CCRA, the Appellant is not required to: (1) apply for a GST number, or (2) collect and remit GST in relation to business transactions on the territory of MBQ.

[9] In this regard the particulars that have not been supplied are: What are the policies of CCRA which exempt First Nation citizens from GST in certain circumstances and what policies of CCRA establish that the Appellant is not required to apply for a GST number or collect and remit GST in relation to business transactions on the territory of MBQ.

[10] It is clear from the above that the Appellant, notwithstanding numerous requests and delays granted, has not complied with the Order of the Court to furnish the required particulars and has failed to prosecute his appeal with due dispatch. Consequently, this constitutes a failure to comply with the Order of this Court dated December 6, 2005 as well as a failure to prosecute the appeal with due dispatch.

[11] I have reviewed the authorities related to this matter and I am satisfied that these failures constitute a ground for dismissal of the appeal.

[12] Consequently, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the Respondent payable forthwith in any event of the cause.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 25th day of September, 2006.
