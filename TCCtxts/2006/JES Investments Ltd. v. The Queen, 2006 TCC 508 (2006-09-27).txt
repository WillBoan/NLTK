JES INVESTMENTS LTD.,

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Sheridan, J.

[1] The Appellant, JES Investments Ltd., is appealing the reassessment of the Minister of National Revenue disallowing eligible Canadian exploration expenses ("CEE") of $100,000 claimed pursuant to section 66 of the Income Tax Act.

Facts

[2] No evidence was called at the hearing. The parties filed a Partial Statement of Agreed Facts[1] which included a copy of the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement[2]:

PARTIAL AGREEMENT OF AGREED FACTS

The parties agree that the following are, for the purposes of this proceeding only, facts upon which the Court may base its decision. The parties shall be free to introduce additional facts in evidence at trial, provided that any facts sought to be introduced in evidence at trial do not contradict in any way the facts agreed to herein. All statutory references are to the Income Tax Act (the "Act").

1. Prior to 1998, Deena Energy Inc. ("Deena") was a corporation whose business was oil and gas exploration and development.

2. In November or December 1997, the Appellant subscribed for and received 90,090 common shares of Deena (the "Shares"), for an aggregate consideration of $100,000 (the "Subscription Amount"), on terms ... in the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement attached as Schedule "A" to this partial statement of agreed facts.

3. Pursuant to the subscription agreement for the Shares (the "Agreement"), Deena agreed to incur CEE or eligible Canadian development expenses in an amount equal to the Subscription Amount on or before December 31, 1998, and to renounce such expenses to the Appellant in accordance with the Act.

4. The Appellant entered into the Agreement with the intention of purchasing Shares that would qualify as flow-through shares under the Act.

5. On January 28, 1998 Deena purported to renounce CEE of $100,000 to the Appellant, effective as of November 1, 1997.

6. On filing its tax return for its 1998 taxation year, the Appellant claimed a $100,000 CEE deduction.

7. Deena did not incur any expenditure eligible for renunciation to the Appellant.

8. The Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") initially assessed the Appellant for its 1998 taxation year by notice dated December 10, 1998.

9. In computing its income for its 1998 taxation year, the Appellant deducted $100,000 of Canadian exploration expenses ("CEE") that Deena Energy Inc. ("Deena") purported to have incurred and renounced to the Appellant under subsection 66(12.6).

10. By Notice of Reassessment dated February 24, 2003 (the "Reassessment"), the Minister reassessed the Appellant's 1998 taxation year. In so doing, the Minister disallowed the Appellant's $100,000 CEE deduction and imposed a penalty under subsection 163(2).

11. On May 22, 2003 the Appellant filed a Notice of Objection to the Reassessment.

12. On June 1, 2004 and in response to the Notice of Objection, the Minister issued a reassessment vacating the subsection 163(2) penalty, but in all other respects confirmed the February 24, 2003 reassessment.

[3] Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Partial Statement of Agreed Facts set out what was supposed to occur. As shown in paragraphs 5 and 7, Deena failed to fulfill its obligations under the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement. Contrary to what had been agreed, Deena did not incur any CEE in respect of the $100,000 received from the Appellant, thus rendering the Appellant ineligible for a CEE deduction. To make matters worse, Deena also provided the Appellant with what was, on its face, the renunciation required under the Act and as contemplated by their agreement.

[4] On the basis of Deena's representations, the Appellant claimed a CEE of $100,000 in its 1998 return. It was not until the end of that year, after Deena had gone into receivership, that the reality of the situation began to appear. Upon his initial review of the company's books and records, the receiver concluded that Deena had incurred only $29,277 of CEE and issued an amended T101 Supplementary form to the Appellant. After further review and a ministerial audit, it was ultimately determined that none of the $100,000 advanced had been put to this purpose.

[5] By the time the true state of affairs became known, Deena was without assets and out of business, leaving the Appellant without any effective remedy to the situation in which it found itself.

[6] The Minister reassessed the Appellant's 1998 and, quite rightly, disallowed the CEE deduction on the basis that no CEE had been incurred by Deena as required by subsection 66(12.6)[3] of the Act. The Minister further concluded, however, that because the Deena shares had been issued to the Appellant under the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement, they were "flow-through shares"[4]; as such, pursuant to subsection 66.3(3)[5], their adjusted cost base was deemed to be nil. Notwithstanding that the Appellant had, in fact, legitimately invested $100,000 in what had become worthless shares in a corporation that had not used the consideration received for those shares in exploration, according to the Minister the Appellant was precluded by the effect of the deeming provision from experiencing a capital loss in respect of them.

Issue

[7] The issue in whether the Appellant is entitled to a capital loss in respect of $100,000 paid for the Deena shares.

Analysis

[8] Counsel were agreed that the purpose of the CEE was to provide an incentive for taxpayers to invest in Canadian companies engaged in exploration. The CEE regime achieved at least three objectives: first, it relieved the government from funding exploration directly from its own coffers. Meanwhile, it provided exploration companies with a source of working capital, often in short supply for such risky ventures. And for investing taxpayers, it ensured (at the very least) a tax deductible loss, with the possibility of a gain upon the disposition of the acquired shares.

[9] It is common ground that the parties intended to structure their affairs in accordance with the CEE regime requirements. It is equally clear that the Appellant fulfilled all of its obligations under the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement. There is no suggestion that the agreement or the transaction was any sort of sham. The only fly in the ointment was Deena, upon whose proper performance of the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement the Appellant was entirely reliant for its CEE deduction eligibility.

[10] It is the Respondent's contention that subsection 66.3(3) precludes the Appellant from claiming a capital loss because:

"... a flow-through share is defined by the terms of the agreement under which it's issued. Subsection 66(15) clearly states that once it's issued, it's a flow-through share, and failure to incur and renounce the expenses that are provided for under the contract doesn't change it's characterizations of a flow-through share."[6]

In support of this proposition, counsel for the Respondent cited various publications[7] positing, among other things, that a share would not cease to be a flow-through share merely because of a corporation's failure to make all of the required expenditures. I appreciate counsel's frankness in acknowledging that the portions of the opinions cited were made in anticipation of proposed changes to the regime and were focused on preventative measures geared to ensuring a successful outcome. As such, however, they are of little assistance in considering what is to be done after the fact, especially given the egregious conduct of the issuing corporation.

[11] Unlike the hypothetical scenarios considered in the literature, the present case is not concerned with a simple shortfall in the total amount of expenses incurred in an otherwise properly performed flow-through share agreement. Central to this appeal is the issuing corporation's utter failure to fulfill its core obligations[8] under the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement; in particular, Deena's having failed to incur any CEE in respect of the consideration advanced for its shares by the Appellant, having neglected entirely its records keeping duties and further, having taken positive action to prevent the Appellant and, for that matter, the Minister from discovering until well after the fact, that it had conducted itself other than in accordance with their agreement and the Act.

[12] While counsel for the Respondent is quite right that on paper, there was a written agreement that provided for the issuance of flow-through shares, that agreement was never, in fact, performed as intended. In these circumstances, the events fundamental to the imbuing of what would be ordinary shares with the specialized characteristics necessary under subsection 66(12.6) simply did not occur. In my view, Deena's breach of the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement together with its subsequent conduct deprived the shares issued under that agreement from ever acquiring their intended status as "flow-through shares". This state of affairs was a fact in existence from the outset; it continued in existence until, and was known to the Minister at the time of the assessment disallowing the CEE deduction.

[13] In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the same deficiency that negated the Appellant's right to the benefits of the CEE regime served equally to liberate it from the restrictions under subsection 66(15). To conclude otherwise on the present facts flies in the face of reality and does a disservice to the cause of justice.

[14] In acquiring the Deena shares, the Appellant had the dual intention of being eligible to claim a CEE deduction and of seeing a return on the $100,000 invested. As it turned out, neither goal was realized. On the quite unusual facts of this case, I am satisfied that the Deena shares never acquired the status of "flow-through shares" and accordingly, subsection 66.3(3) does not operate to deem the adjusted cost base of the Deena shares to be "nil". Accordingly, the Appellant is entitled to claim a capital loss in respect of its investment in the Deena shares.

[15] In view of these findings, it is not necessary for me to consider the effect, if any, of Clause 10 of the Subscription and Renunciation Agreement on the status of the Deena shares.

[16] The appeal is allowed, with costs, and the matter is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the Appellant is entitled to claim a capital loss in respect of the shares acquired from Deena.
