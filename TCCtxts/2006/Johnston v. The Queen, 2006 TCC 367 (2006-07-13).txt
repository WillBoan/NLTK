Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Bell, J.

[1] The Appellant was represented by his wife, Anita Johnston.

[2] Although she agreed with the reassessment she gave evidence about a matter not in issue, namely her experience with the revenue department's inquiry line. She said that she, in preparing the Appellant's income tax return, had called about 12 different people of the 800 information line and that she had received different responses as to how she should prepare her return using a revenue department approved software program. She testified that some persons to whom she spoke were critical of the information others had given. She said that the reason the Appellant proceeded with the Appeal was because of the extraordinary difficulties with the toll free revenue agents.

[3] The Appeal, on the basis of the Appellant's agreement with the assessment, will be dismissed. I am writing these brief Reasons for Judgment in order to recommend highly, in the aggravating circumstances, that the Minister of National Revenue waive any interest that otherwise would be payable on the tax owing under the reassessment.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of July, 2006.
