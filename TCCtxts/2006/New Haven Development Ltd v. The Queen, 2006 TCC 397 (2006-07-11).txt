Docket: 2004-3524(GST)G

BETWEEN:

NEW HAVEN DEVELOPMENT LTD.,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR ORDER AND ORDER

Beaubier, J.

[1] Upon reviewing the unsigned Notice of Motion by the Appellant dated June 30, 2006, and without presenting it to the Respondent or receiving evidence that the Respondent has been served with it,

[2] The Motion of the Appellant dated June 30, 2006, and filed with the Court by fax at 3:02 p.m. that day, is denied. It alleges that the Appellant is without funds. When under oath in Examination for Discovery, its officer, Mr. Stevens, (the alleged instituter of this Motion) stated "Okay. We're not concerned about expenses here. We're just here to have a little fun and kind of enjoy the legal system." This Motion, its date of issue, and its allegation of a lack of funds confirm this attitude and the Appellant's intended course of action as stated at the Examination for Discovery. The current allegation of lack of funds flies in the face of Mr. Stevens' statement when under oath.

Signed at Kelowna, British Columbia this 10th day of July, 2006.

"D. W. Beaubier"
