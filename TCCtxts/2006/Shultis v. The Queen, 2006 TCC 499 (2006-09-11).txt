(ii) meal preparation;

(iii) housekeeping for the resident's personal living space;

(iv) laundry services for the resident's personal items;

(v) transportation driver; and

(vi) security in secure units.

B. ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

12. The issue is whether the Appellant was:

(a) entitled to claim the Amount paid to Renoir as medical expenses under section 118.2 of the Act; or

(b) limited to claiming only $10,000.00 of the Amount under section 118.2 of the Act and the DTC of $6,180.00 under section 118.3 of the Act;

in the computation of his non-refundable tax credits for the 2002 taxation year.

C. STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT

13. He relies on sections 118.2 and 118.3 of the Act, as amended for the 2002 taxation year.

[3] None of the assumptions were refuted by the evidence.

[4] The question is whether the Appellant incurred a medical expense for his care at an institution or other place who required facilities or personnel specially provided by the Renoir for the care of the handicap suffered by the Appellant within the provisions of paragraph 118.2(2)(e) of the Income Tax Act, which reads:

...

118.2.(2) Medical expenses

(2) For the purposes of subsection 118.2(1), a medical expense of an individual is an amount paid

...

(e) for the care, or the care and training, at a school, institution or other place of the patient, who has been certified by an appropriately qualified person to be a person who, by reason of a physical or mental handicap, requires the equipment, facilities or personnel specially provided by that school, institution or other place for the care, or the care and training, of individuals suffering from the handicap suffered by the patient;

...

[5] All of the witnesses testified that the Renoir is a retirement home. Two Calgaryhomes are operated by Mr. Waldmann's corporation "Registered Retirement Group" with a "safe unit" for dementia patients consisting of an area of rooms within which patients are locked, so that they are constantly supervised by staff and from which they cannot wander. The Renoir does not have this and Mr. Shultis is not so confined.

[6] Part of the reason that this was possible in 2002 is that Mr. and Mrs. Shultis were each handicapped but were able to help each other while being provided with meals and the minimal medical services available in the Renoir where a R.P.N. is on duty for the residents.

[7] In the Court's view, the Appellant does not require or receive special facilities or personnel for the care of his handicaps, nor were they provided by the Renoir to him in 2002. None were designed for a particular purpose for him or for his class of resident. In part this is because his wife was still of assistance, and in part this is because his medications had become "bubble" packaged.

[8] Had the Appellant required the "safe unit" care described in paragraph [5], this decision might have been different. But that was not the case in 2002.

[9] For this reason, the appeal is dismissed.
