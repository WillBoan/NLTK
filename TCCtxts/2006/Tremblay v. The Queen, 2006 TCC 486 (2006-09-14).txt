REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Tardif J.

[1] These are appeals from assessments made by the Minister of National Revenue ("the Minister") under the Income Tax Act ("the Act") in respect of the 2000 and 2001 taxation years.

[2] The issue is whether, in computing the Appellant's income from an office or employment for these taxation years, the Minister properly disallowed the deduction of the amounts of $8,315 and $10,699, which had been claimed as "other employment expenses".

[3] In making and confirming the assessments, the Minister assumed the following facts:

[4] In support of his case, which he had the burden to prove, the Appellant essentially argued that he received income in two different capacities: as an employee of Combined Insurance Company of America, and as a commissioned salesperson with the same company.

[5] He submitted two contracts in support of his arguments: his commissioned agent's contract and his district manager's contract.

[6] The Appellant was reimbursed by Combined Insurance Company of America for the expenses associated with his work as a salaried manager.

[7] Thus, he claimed that the only expenses for which he was reimbursed were the expenses incurred as part of his salaried employment. He submitted that in addition to being reimbursed by his employer for his expenses, he was entitled to deduct the expenses incurred in relation to his commissioned work.

[8] For his part, the person responsible for the Appellant's file explained the steps leading up to his assessment. He admitted that he assumed that the expenses had been incurred for the Appellant's work as a whole. The expenses taken into account were the ones that the employer reimbursed.

[9] In order to establish that his claim was meritorious, the Appellant, to avoid confusion, would have had to persuasively and coherently show which expenses were directly related to each of his two positions.

[10] The Appellant was unable accurately to show how many kilometres were driven in connection with each of his positions; with very little conviction, he submitted that the office expense reimbursement essentially corresponded to the cost of long-distance calls, but the relevant documents did not support this interpretation at all.

[11] Otherwise, the bulk of the Appellant's representations sought to show that a distinction should be drawn between his two sources of income: employment income; and income from commissioned self-employment.

[12] Even the evidence submitted with respect to this aspect was not decisive. Indeed, the fact that the Appellant signed a contract several years ago, setting out his conditions of employment and establishing that he was paid by commission, does not automatically have the effect of demonstrating the validity of his allegations, especially since the legal relationship described in the contract might well have been necessary in order for the Appellant to have employee status, which enabled him occasionally to hold himself up as an example to the salespersons under his supervision.

[13] All assessments are presumed to have been made in accordance with the relevant facts and applicable legislation. An attack against the merits of an assessment requires more than mere criticism of the Minister's approach; it is absolutely essential to prove what the assessment should have been.

[14] Here, the Appellant essentially submitted that he had two different functions, and that this enabled him to claim expenses in excess of what his employer reimbursed. It would have been important, and perhaps even fundamental, for him to submit decisive evidence as to the details of the disallowed expenses that were associated exclusively with his self-employment.

[15] In the absence of such evidence, I must find that the Appellant has not met his burden of proof, and, consequently, the appeals are dismissed.
