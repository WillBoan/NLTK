REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Beaubier, J.

[1] This appeal was heard at Calgary, Alberta, on February 7, 2006. The Appellant testified and called his foreman when he was labouring at paving job sites, Robert Bennett. The Respondent called the Ruling Officer on the file, Dianne Bailey, and the Intervenor, Commercial Paving Ltd. (“CP”), called its founder and director, the Appellant’s father, Salvatore (“Sam”) Montagnese.

[2] Paragraphs 5-9 inclusive of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal set out the particulars in dispute. They read:

B. ISSUE TO BE DECIDED

7. The issue to be decided is whether the Minister properly exercised the use of the Minister’s discretionary authority in deciding that the Appellant was engaged in excluded employment with the Payor.

C. STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT

8. The Respondent relies on section 93, subsections 2(1) and 5(3) and paragraphs 5(1)(a) and 5(2)(i) of the Employment Insurance Act and section 251 of the Act.

9. The Respondent submits that the Minister properly exercised the use of the Minster’s discretionary authority in the Minister’s decision that the Appellant and the Payor would not have entered into a substantially similar contract of employment if they had been dealing with each other at arm’s length. Accordingly, the Appellant was engaged in excluded employment with the Payor during the period from April 26, 2004 to November 30, 2004 within the meaning of paragraph 5(2)(i) and subsection 5(3) of the Employment Insurance Act.

[3] Assumptions 6(a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (i), (j), (l), (n), (o), (p), (q), (v), (w), (x), (y), (z), (aa), (bb), (dd), (ff), (gg), (hh), (ii), (jj), (kk) and (ll) were not refuted. But they are conditioned by the comments that follow in these reasons.

[4] Respecting the remaining assumptions:

6(b) The Payor could pave after freeze up on dry frozen ground or surfaces although it did not do so normally.

6(g) The Appellant was not hired as a labourer in 2004. By then Sam was over 60 and the business was beginning to slow down as he aged. Tony, Joe and Sam met and agreed that starting in 2004 they would each be paid $50,000 per year for each paving season and that Sam would ease off in his duties and Tony and Joe would come in as Project Managers to get work for the Payor, purchase new equipment, estimate jobs under $100,000, manage the business and work as labourers on job sites under Robert Bennett who remained as foreman. Sam would supervise and estimate jobs over $100,000, Sam is more or less illiterate in English and Tony and his sister had written out bids for him as school children. Tony and Joe (Gio) had also laboured in the business throughout their school years. Robert Bennett confirmed the statements that, starting in 2004 when Tony and Joe became Project Managers, the business had improved, whereas before that, it was starting to fail.

6(h) Tony supervised the Payor’s purchasing and did estimates under $100,000. Sam supervised operations and did estimates over $100,000.

6(k) Tony’s salary was $50,000 per year for the paving season as was Joe’s and Sam’s.

6(m) Is correct, but Tony was only a labourer in 2003.

6(r) Tony’s wage rate was reasonable. In his former job he earned over $50,000 per year in a supervisory position. Sam testified that his understanding of wages when he made his deal with the boys was that similar dutied construction employees were earning $60,000 to $80,000 per year. To leave those jobs and hire on with a failing small paving firm such as the Payor had been in 2003 with a view to putting it on its feet and taking over the Payor would require a wage of at least $50,000 per year and Tony knew the business, had written estimates for his father, had supervised in business for others and had earned higher wages. For the Payor to hire such a person in its circumstances in 2003 and 2004 would require at least $50,000 per year.

6(s) The change in salary from 2003 to 2004 was reasonable because the duties changed to an even greater degree than the salary did.

6(t) and (u) are correct, but estimating, bidding, purchasing, managing and advertising the business could be done in bad weather, in off season and after 4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday.

6(cc) Is incorrect. It is reasonable to pave as long as conditions allow it. In some years that can be after November in Calgary, Alberta, where the Payor was and is located.

6(ee) In 2004 Sam, the Shareholder, reduced his work load as Tony and Joe began to manage projects, operate equipment, estimate and bid for business.

6(mm) Tony and Joe had been operating this equipment since they were boys. They hardly needed more than a refresher. However everyone was careful to keep Robert Bennett on as a foreman, since he had started in the Payor’s business when he was a teenager.

6(nn) and (oo) These subparagraphs express subsection 5(3) of the Employment Insurance Act. They will be dealt with in what follows. However answers 18, 23 and 25 to the Minister’s questionnaire (A-2) state that Tony was not a simple labourer and this was in the Minister’s possession. Answer 11 provided Tony’s business academic training. Other answers stated Tony’s non-labour duties for the Payor.

[5] The result is that the Payor would have to pay $50,000 per seasonal year to hire someone with Tony’s training and experience to become a Project Manager, working hands-on on site at paving jobs for a small, failing, paving contractor in Calgary, Alberta in 2004 having regard to the terms and conditions of the job, the duration of the job and its importance to the long term survival of the company. The Payor and Tony would have entered into a substantially similar contract if they had been dealing with each other at arm’s length.

[6] What the Payor was hiring with someone with Tony’s experience, education and training was its future. Without that, the Payor probably would not exist in 2006. It had not had such a position before. Rather Sam was a one-man show, operating the Payor on that basis and the Payor’s business was declining.

[7] The appeal is allowed. The Minister did not properly exercise his discretionary authority in deciding that the Appellant was engaged in excluded employment with the Payor from April 26, 2004 to November 30, 2004.
