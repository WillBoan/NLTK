REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

(Delivered orally from the bench on

September 15, 2006, at Vancouver, British Columbia.)

Miller J.

[1] Normally I am very hesitant in granting such applications to deny a taxpayer their day in Court, but under these circumstances, with two prior adjournments, with the matter being set down on a peremptory basis I am prepared to grant your application and I will dismiss this case. Ms. Karlsson will be advised that she does have an opportunity to appeal my decision. That will be her call, whether she wants to continue this litigation.

[2] I grant you your request, and the appeal is dismissed. Thank you.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 20th day of November 2006.

"Campbell J. Miller"
