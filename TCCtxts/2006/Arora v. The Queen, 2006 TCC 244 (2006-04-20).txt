REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Bell, J.



[1] The Appellant, in his 1992 taxation sustained a loss in the amount of $485,250 in respect of a real estate property purchased by him for the avowed purpose of reselling at a profit. In fact he sustained a loss in the above amount.

[2] His Counsel submitted that the amount of $323,500 was a non-capital loss and the amount of $161,750 was a capital loss. The closing date of the purchase was some two years after the purchase was made. According to counsel, because of the Appellant's inability to sell the property, he decided to change the use and attempted to rent same. At that point Counsel submitted that the property became capital property, resulting in the claim of non-capital and capital losses as above described. The only non-business losses available to be claimed were with respect to the 1998 taxation years as to $8,662 and with respect to the 1999 taxation years as at $21,822, the ability to carry non-business losses forward having expired in 1999.

[3] Since no capital gain existed in the years under appeal, no decision was made by the Court as to whether the amount of $161,750 or any part thereof, was a capital loss. That matter remains to be determined in the future if a claim for deduction of a capital loss from an amount of capital gain arises.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada this 20th day of April, 2006.
