[1] This appeal was heard at Lethbridge, Alberta. The Appellant's husband, Neal, testified and also called Theodore Pedersen, a cook at the restaurant managed by Neal, owned by Neal's parents and where Sanna worked during the time in question at Fort McLeod, Alberta.

[2] The Appellant's application for Employment Insurance was denied. Paragraphs 5 to 7 inclusive of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal set out the matters in dispute. They read:

B. ISSUE TO BE DECIDED

7. The issue to be decided is whether the Minister properly exercised the use of the Minister's discretionary authority in deciding that the Appellant was engaged in excluded employment with the Payor.

[3] All of the assumptions except 6 (j), (n), (o), (p), (s), (t), (u), (v), (bb) and (nn) were not refuted and do not require comment; (pp) and (qq) are the essence of the dispute.

[4] Respecting the above described assumptions in paragraph 6 of the Reply:

(j) It appears to have been common that the Payor did not always pay staff who were learning their jobs as new would-be employees. That was Sanna's situation in 2004.

(n) The credit card was Neal's, not the Payor's. The Payor's purchases were also on Neal's card. In order to collect points, Neal's card was used heavily by all these parties.

(o) It was not uncommon for employees to cash their cheques at the Payor's or to withdraw cash advances against wages owed and, on occasion, against future wages. FortMcLeod is a small somewhat isolated town, employees are hard to find, and so the Payor had to accommodate them.

(p) The Appellant's rate of pay was reasonable. She was paid in part when she charged purchases against Neal's credit card. This may have been "unreasonable", but no other employees did this and it was "unusual".

(s) None of the Seifeddine family recorded their hours. Ted testified that they worked about the same or sometimes more hours than other employees, as did Sanna. He is believed.

(t) This was also done for other employees.

(u) For her first learning month, Sanna completed a time sheet. She did not during the period in question. Nor did other Seifeddines.

(bb)Neal and his brother, Brian, controlled the Payor's activities and made decisions.

(nn)The Appellant replaced a worker, Wayne, when she was hired in January after two cooks left. When she left in May, she was not replaced.

[5] Assumptions (pp) and (qq) are the essence of the legal problem before the Court. With respect to them:

(pp)The remuneration paid Sanna, including her raise, was at a normal rate for this Payor-employer in Fort McLeod. The duration and nature and importance of Sanna's work was also normal for a worker of her experience. The conditions of her employment, generally, were also typical of the Payor's treatment of arm's length employees in FortMcLeod. Sanna was on a monthly salary, but it was at an hourly rate with working hours that were about the same as arm's length employees. However, the manner of payment was not usual. There were two differences: the credits against Neal's credit card, and the $1,500 payment described in assumption 6 (x). Both of these did not occur with other employees, in or out of the Seifeddine family. They are of a nature that could occur in slave-like "employment" situations elsewhere in Canada, or they could occur in a family situation. The extenuating circumstance in Sanna's case is that she could not speak English. She immigrated to Canadain June 2004 from the Middle East and immediately married Neal. She did not know our language, culture, kinds of stores or any of the practice of daily life in Canada; this fact goes a long way towards explaining the use of Neal's credit card.

However, 4 things - the failure to record hours, the monthly salary, the charges against Neal's credit card, and the sporadic and $1,500 payment were all terms of employment and pay that would not have occurred respecting an employee at arm's length even if that employee had suffered from language difficulties.

(qq)Thus it is reasonable to conclude that the Appellant and the Payor would not have entered into a substantially similar contract of employment if they had been dealing with each other at arm's length.

[6] The Minister properly exercised the use of the Minister's discretionary authority in deciding that the Appellant was engaged in excluded employment with the Payor.

[7] The appeal is dismissed.
