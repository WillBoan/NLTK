REASONS FOR ORDER

(Appeal called for hearing and decision rendered orally from the Bench

on July 16, 2015 at Montréal, Quebec.)

Boyle J.

[1] Mr. Mentor’s appeal is being dismissed at the Crown’s request for failure to appear.

[2] This Court has jurisdiction to award costs as part of the regulation of its processes and the potential abuse of its processes: see, for example, the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Fournier v. Canada (2005 FCA 131).

[3] Rules 10 and 11 of the Court’s Informal Procedure Rules also now expressly permit costs awards against Informal appellants if their actions unduly delayed the prompt and effective resolution of the appeal.

[4] This is clearly a case where costs are warranted. At some point the taxpayer appears to have decided to not actually pursue the appeal he started. A phone call or letter to the Court or the Crown would have promptly and efficiently led to the discontinuance or dismissal of this appeal. Canadian taxpayers are absolutely entitled to their day in court but they are not entitled to waste what should be another taxpayer’s day in court.

[5] With respect to the amount of costs, I will give the taxpayer the benefit of the doubt and presume he launched his appeal in good faith at the outset. This would have necessitated the Crown’s reply. I am therefore fixing costs at $250, which is only the amount set out in Rule 11 for the preparation for today’s hearing.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 23rd day of July 2015.
