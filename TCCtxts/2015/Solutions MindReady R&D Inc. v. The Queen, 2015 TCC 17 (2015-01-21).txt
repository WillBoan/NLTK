REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Favreau J.

[1] This is an appeal from the reassessments dated April 1, 2008, made by the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the Act), concerning the taxation years ending on November 29, 2005, and on December 31, 2005.

[2] In making the reassessments dated April 1, 2008, the Minister made the following changes relative to the investment tax credit (ITC) claimed by the appellant in respect of the taxation years ending on November 29, 2005, and December 31, 2005.

[3] The Minister determined that the appellant was not entitled to refundable ITCs at the rate of 35% for the taxation years ending on November 29, 2005, and December 31, 2005, for the following reasons:

(a) The appellant did not qualify as a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) because it was a corporation controlled, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatever, by a public corporation within the meaning of subsection 125(7) of the Act; and

(b) The reorganization undertaken for the purpose of transferring scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) activities including creating corporations, withdrawing all of the powers of the appellant’s directors, transactions to transfer activities as well as transactions enabling the flow of funds within the corporate group constitute an abuse of the tax system warranting the application of the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) set out in section 245 of the Act.

[4] On or about April 28, 2008, the appellant objected to reassessments made in respect of the taxation years ending on November 29, 2005, and December 31, 2005. On December 23, 2011, the appellant filed its Notice of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada before the Minister had made his decision on the objection.

[5] At the hearing, the parties filed a partial agreement on the facts dated April 25, 2014. The facts agreed on are as follows:

65. For the years at issue, PUBLIQUE INC. rented a space of about 50,000 square feet located at 2800 Marie-Curie Avenue in Ville St-Laurent.

66. A service agreement between PUBLIQUE INC. and the appellant was signed on August 1, 2005, for the leasing or sub-leasing by the appellant of a portion of this space and of some movable property .

67. Under the service agreement, the appellant rented a portion (about 25%) of the premises occupied by PUBLIQUE INC.

68. For the years at issue, the person who authorized the transfers of funds between the bank accounts of the various entities for, among other things, the payment of inter-company invoices and the subscriptions was Marc Lamy.

69. Several important agreements between PUBLIQUE INC. and the appellant were signed only by Marc Lamy as vice-president of the appellant and chief financial officer of PUBLIQUE INC.

70. PUBLIQUE INC. issued cheques or made transfers of funds to the appellant regularly (at least once a month) based on its operational needs, for example, when the appellant’s bank account was in a deficit or when it needed to pay salaries.

71. During the years at issue, PUBLIQUE INC. was the appellant’s only client.

72. To meet its obligations under the research contract, the appellant had access to funding through PUBLIQUE INC., AUTEURCO, the TRUST, BENEFICIARY 1, and BENEFICIARY 2.

73. The appellant had its own employees, who were acquired from PUBLIQUE INC., on August 1, 2005.

74. The salaries of the appellant’s employees were the only current expense paid directly from the appellant’s bank account.

75. However, for the reasons mentioned above, the money with which the appellant paid its employees came indirectly from PUBLIQUE INC.

76. Rent expenses, management fees, corporate fees and royalties were paid either by inter-company settlements or by accounting entries.

77. No interest was ever required on the various advances of funds between PUBLIQUE INC. and the appellant.

78. According to the research contract, PUBLIQUE INC. was the owner of the intellectual property and of the results of every research project[11] carried out by the appellant because the projects had initially been started by PUBLIQUE INC. and transferred to the appellant.

79. Based on the research contract, PUBLIQUE INC. was responsible for indemnifying the appellant and for exempting it, for any actions, expenses or claims including legal and extrajudicial expensesarising out of the performanceof t the research contract, unless the appellant or a third party not under its control was negligent.

80. An external accounting firm consolidated the financial statements of PUBLIQUE INC. and the appellant based on the CICA Accounting Guideline (AcG 15) as stated in footnote 3 of the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2005.

[6] The structure put in place to qualify the appellant as a Canadian-controlled private corporation was recommended by the accounting firm KPMG and is the same as the structure used by Lyrtech inc. to qualify its research subsidiary Lyrtech RD inc. The main difference between the facts of this appeal and those in the appeal of Lyrtech RD inc. is that the agreements governing the relationships between the parties involved in this appeal were better complied with, while the agreements governing the relationships between the parties involved in the appeal of Lyrtech RD inc. were not all complied with. For example, adjusting entries should have been made as part of preparing Lyrtech RD inc.’s financial statements. It should be recalled that Lyrtech RD inc.’s appeal was decided by this Court (Lyrtech RD inc. v. R., 2013 TCC 12) and affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in a decision dated November 17, 2014 (Lyrtech RD inc. v. The Queen, 2014 FCA 267).

[7] Solutions MindReady inc. declared bankruptcy in 2007, and on February 28, 2008, Averna Technologies inc. purchased some of its assets from the trustee, including the shares of Mindready Solutions (NI) Limited (Mindready Ireland), 6420605 Canada inc. and their respective subsidiaries, namely, 6420958 Canada inc., 6420931 Canada inc., Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady and Solutions MindReady R&D inc.

[8] Paul Martineau, Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Averna Technologies inc., explained the business reasons that led to his company wanting to acquire the assets of Solutions MindReady inc. The reasons included hiring qualified employees, acquiring marketable products and the rights to two products under development as well as access to a client network.

[9] Following the acquisition of assets, the agreements concluded between Solutions MindReady inc. and Solutions MindReady R&D inc. were terminated the trust deed was amended, and new trustees were appointed, but the structure put in place by Solutions MindReady inc. was maintained, and the entities it was made up of still exist even though they are inactive.

[10] At the time of the acquisition of assets, Solutions MindReady R&D inc. had about thirty employees, who became employees of Averna Technologies inc. with a new contract of employment recognizing their years of seniority.

[11] Claude Delage and Marc Lamy, respectively, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Solutions MindReady inc. testified at the hearing. They explained that they became shareholders of Solutions MindReady inc. together with Michel Gaucher after a takeover bid made on May 28, 2004, by which 4173422 Canada inc., a corporation belonging to Messrs. Gaucher, Delage and Lamy, acquired a block of 8,519,580 shares representing 71% of the issued and outstanding shares.

[12] On November 30, 2005, Solutions MindReady inc. acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of UTTC United Tri-Tech Corporation, an electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company. Immediately before that acquisition, the share ownership of Solutions MindReady inc. was as follows:

[14] Marc Lamy and Claude Delage were directors and officers of all of the entities created during the reorganization of the research and development activities of Solutions MindReady inc. and were also the two trustees of the Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady. In that capacity, they signed all documents related to the entities.

[15] According to the Annual Information Form of Solutions MindReady inc. dated March 31, 2006, the board of directors then was comprised of four members after the resignation of Marcel Lu. The members of the board of directors at that time were Michel Gaucher, Claude Delage, Marc Lamy and Jean-François Rabouille, a vice-president of Groupe Dynamis inc. They all became directors of Solutions MindReady inc. on May 31, 2004, following the takeover bid.

[16] Claude Delage remained a director of Solutions MindReady inc. and of all its subsidiaries until June 22, 2006, when he resigned due to an illness. The date of his resignation as trustee of the Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady was July 31, 2006.

[17] Marc Lamy remained a director of Solutions MindReady inc. and of all its subsidiaries until August 5, 2007, when he resigned following a dispute with the board of directors. The date of his resignation as trustee of the Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady was also August 5, 2007.

[18] Claude Delage explained in his testimony that research and development activities were essential to the survival of Solutions MindReady inc.’s business and that the restructuring of the research and development activities was presented to the board of directors as an improvement to the R&D tax credits. The choice of research work was determined by Solutions MindReady inc. but the performance of the work was entrusted to the appellant. He also acknowledged that the revenues generated by the appellant’s research activities were insufficient to pay the salaries of employees assigned to that activity and that the Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady and the appellant were described in the corporate documentation of Solutions MindReady inc. as subsidiaries. The appellant’s financial results were consolidated with those of Solutions MindReady inc. Marc Lamy was in charge of implementing the restructuring of the research activities of Solutions MindReady inc.

[19] According to Mr. Lamy, the objective was to make the appellant operationally autonomous without making it a profit centre. To do so, Solutions MindReady inc. transferred to the appellant through a tax rollover some assets and the employment contracts of employees assigned to R&D, the value of which was estimated at $110,617. In addition, Solutions MindReady inc. leased or subleased, as the case may be, to the appellant certain assets and subleased to it the office space allocated to research activities. For the use of equipment, the appellant undertook to pay an annual base rent of $77,122.44 payable in quarterly equal and consecutive payments of $19,280.61, including management fees of 10%. For the immovable sublease, the rent was $249,382.08 payable in equal and consecutive monthly payments of $20,781.84, including management fees of 10%. After the employees were transferred to the appellant, they continued to carry out their duties on the same premises and in the same way in respect of the same research projects.

[20] Only one research contract was concluded between Solutions MindReady inc. and the appellant. The appellant exclusively carried out the research projects of Solutions MindReady inc. All of the funding needed to conduct the research activities came from Solutions MindReady inc. The appellant billed Solutions MindReady inc. monthly for the cost of the services that it provided to it without mark-up, but it did not bill for the cost of labour related to the research activities. However, Solutions MindReady inc. billed the appellant the cost of administrative services provided to the appellant. The cost of labour related to the research activities was directly funded by Solutions MindReady inc. through bank transfers to the appellant’s bank account used to pay research salaries.

[21] The inter-company invoices were normally paid through bank transfers. The authorized signing officers for the bank accounts of Solutions MindReady inc., 6420605 Canada inc., 6420958 Canada inc., 6420931 Canada inc., Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady and the appellant were two of the following five persons:

- Marc Lamy;

- Jean Mayer, Legal Counsel and Corporate Secretary;

- Christian Moreau, Vice-President, Operations;

- Mélanie Dupuis, Corporate Controller;

- Marie-France Huard, Controller.

[22] The intellectual property of the R&D work performed by the appellant belonged to Solutions MindReady inc., but the appellant was entitled to royalties based on the sale price of the products, which were improved by the R&D work resulting from the research projects. From August 1, 2005, to December 31, 2006, the royalty rate was 2%. For 2007, the royalty rate was 5%, while for the years starting after January 1, 2008, the rate increased to 10%. In addition to the royalties, the appellant was entitled to receive 25% of the amounts collected by Solutions MindReady inc. for the granting of operating licences for products resulting from the R&D work or from the sale of intellectual property rights arising from the R&D work. For the taxation year ending on November 30, 2005, the appellant received royalties totalling $42,773 from product sales, but nothing for the granting of licences or for the sale of intellectual property rights. For the taxation year ending on December 31, 2005, the appellant received only $7,971 in royalties.

[23] The appellant maintains that, since its creation, it has always been a CCPC because no public corporation controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, the composition of the appellant’s board of directors.

[24] Solutions MindReady inc. never exercised direct or indirect control in any manner whatever over the appellant for the purposes of the Act. Solutions MindReady inc. and the appellant created a business relationship between them that was similar to any other contractual research relationship, where research is carried out by a newly incorporated research business. There is no element of the contractual relationship that existed between these two entities that could confer on Solutions MindReady inc. a greater influence on the appellant’s operations than the influence normally exercised by any major client on one of its main suppliers. The influence is not sufficient and is not of the type that conferred on Solutions MindReady inc. control in fact of the appellant as described in subsection 256(5.1) of the Act.

[25] None of the transactions described by the respondent are an abusive avoidance transaction subject to the GAAR.

B. Respondent’s position

[26] Despite the reorganization carried out by Solutions MindReady inc., the appellant was not a CCPC because it was subject to de facto control by Solutions MindReady inc.; it had pre-dominant power over appointing the appellant’s trustee directors, and the appellant was dependent on Solutions MindReady inc. operationally and economically.

[27] The phrase “controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever” used in paragraph 125(7)(a) of the Act gives precedence to de facto control over de jure control. The presence of de facto control of a private corporation by a public corporation is sufficient to exclude it from the definition of CCPC.

[28] The reorganization undertaken by Solutions MindReady inc. was identical to that carried out by the parent company of Lyrtech RD inc., regarding which this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that the parent company Lyrtech inc. exercised de facto control over Lyrtech RD inc. and that, accordingly, it was not a CCPC.

[29] As an alternative argument, the respondent submits that the GAAR is applicable in this case because the three conditions for the GAAR to apply are met in the reorganization. First, there must be a tax benefit arising from a “transaction” under subsections 245(1) and 245(2) of the Act. Second, the transaction that generated the tax benefit must be an avoidance transaction under subsection 245(3) of the Act, that is, the transaction must not have been arranged for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit for the purposes of the GAAR. Third, the avoidance transaction must be abusive within the meaning of subsection 245(4) of the Act. The appellant has the burden of proving that there was no tax benefit or avoidance transaction, while the respondent must establish that the avoidance transaction was abusive. According to the respondent, the three conditions are met and the tax benefit must be denied under subsection 245(5) of the Act.

[30] The provisions of the Act that are relevant for the purposes of this dispute are as follows: paragraph (a) of the definition of “public corporation” under subsection 89(1), the definition of “Canadian-controlled private corporation” under subsection 125(7), the definition of “non-qualifying corporation” under subsection 127(9), subsection 127(10.1), the definition of “qualifying corporation” under subsection 127.1(2), subsection 251(5) and subsections 256(5.1), 256(6.1) and 256(6.2). These provisions read as follows:

(b) where at any time a person has a right under a contract, in equity or otherwise, either immediately or in the future and either absolutely or contingently,

(i) to, or to acquire, shares of the capital stock of a corporation or to control the voting rights of such shares, the person shall, except where the right is not exercisable at that time because the exercise thereof is contingent on the death, bankruptcy or permanent disability of an individual, be deemed to have the same position in relation to the control of the corporation as if the person owned the shares at that time,

(ii) to cause a corporation to redeem, acquire or cancel any shares of its capital stock owned by other shareholders of the corporation, the person shall, except where the right is not exercisable at that time because the exercise thereof is contingent on the death, bankruptcy or permanent disability of an individual, be deemed to have the same position in relation to the control of the corporation as if the shares were so redeemed, acquired or cancelled by the corporation at that time;

(iii) to, or to acquire or control, voting rights in respect of shares of the capital stock of a corporation, the person is, except where the right is not exercisable at that time because its exercise is contingent on the death, bankruptcy or permanent disability of an individual, deemed to have the same position in relation to the control of the corporation as if the person could exercise the voting rights at that time, or

(iv) to cause the reduction of voting rights in respect of shares, owned by other shareholders, of the capital stock of a corporation, the person is, except where the right is not exercisable at that time because its exercise is contingent on the death, bankruptcy or permanent disability of an individual, deemed to have the same position in relation to the control of the corporation as if the voting rights were so reduced at that time; and

(c) where a person owns shares in two or more corporations, the person shall as shareholder of one of the corporations be deemed to be related to himself, herself or itself as shareholder of each of the other corporations.

256(5.1) For the purposes of this Act, where the expression “controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever,” is used, a corporation shall be considered to be so controlled by another corporation, person or group of persons (in this subsection referred to as the “controller”) at any time where, at that time, the controller has any direct or indirect influence that, if exercised, would result in control in fact of the corporation, except that, where the corporation and the controller are dealing with each other at arm’s length and the influence is derived from a franchise, licence, lease, distribution, supply or management agreement or other similar agreement or arrangement, the main purpose of which is to govern the relationship between the corporation and the controller regarding the manner in which a business carried on by the corporation is to be conducted, the corporation shall not be considered to be controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, by the controller by reason only of that agreement or arrangement.

256(6.1) For the purposes of this Act and for greater certainty,

(a) where a corporation (in this paragraph referred to as the “subsidiary”) would be controlled by another corporation (in this paragraph referred to as the “parent”) if the parent were not controlled by any person or group of persons, the subsidiary is controlled by

(i) the parent, and

(ii) any person or group of persons by whom the parent is controlled; and

(b) where a corporation (in this paragraph referred to as the “subject corporation”) would be controlled by a group of persons (in this paragraph referred to as the “first-tier group”) if no corporation that is a member of the first-tier group were controlled by any person or group of persons, the subject corporation is controlled by

(i) the first-tier group, and

(ii) any group of one or more persons comprised of, in respect of every member of the first-tier group, either the member, or a person or group of persons by whom the member is controlled.

256(6.2) In its application to subsection (5.1), subsection (6.1) shall be read as if the references in subsection (6.1) to “controlled” were references to “controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever,”.

[31] The Minister determined that the appellant did not qualify as a CCPC throughout the taxation years ending on November 30, 2005, and December 31, 2005, because it was a corporation controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, by Solutions MindReady inc., a public corporation within the meaning of the Act. The Minister thus disallowed the appellant (a) the 15% increase in the investment tax credit claimed by the appellant under subsection 127(10.1) of the Act, and (b) the refund of this tax credit under subsection 127.1(1) of the Act.

[32] In 1988, subsection 256(5.1) was added to the Act in order to define, for the purposes of the Act, the phase “controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever” in order to introduce the concept of control in fact. Thus, a corporation is considered to be controlled by another corporation at any time where, at that time, that other corporation has any direct or indirect influence that, if exercised, would result in control in fact of the corporation.

[33] Since the enactment of subsection 256(5.1) of the Act, the exercise of de facto control by a public corporation over another corporation has necessarily resulted in the exclusion of that other corporation from the definition of a CCPC, regardless of whether de jure control is exercised by another person.

[34] In this case, the respondent does not dispute that Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady exercised de jure control over the appellant. According to the trust deed, only the directors of Solutions MindReady inc. were eligible to be trustees. During the periods at issue, the trustees were Marc Lamy and Claude Delage. By means of a declaration of sole shareholder, the trustees withdrew all of the powers held by the appellant’s directors to exercise them themselves. Marc Lamy and Claude Delage were directors of the appellant as well as of Solutions MindReady inc., 6420605 Canada inc., 6420958 Canada inc. and 6420931 Canada inc.

[35] Following the decisions of this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal in Mimetix Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Canada, [2001] F.C.J. No. 749 (Lamarre J.) affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal, 2003 FCA 106; Plomberie J.C. Langlois Inc. v. Canada, 2004 TCC 734 (Lamarre-Proulx J.) affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal, 2006 FCA 113; L.D.G. 2000 Inc. v. Canada, [2002] F.C.J. No. 659 (Angers J.); and more recently in Lyrtech RD Inc. v. The Queen, 2013 TCC 12, affirmed by the Federal Court Appeal, 2014 FCA 267, the law is now well settled: the determination of the influence necessary for a corporation to be considered as being controlled by another corporation requires the examination of the operational and economic decisions of the corporation in question. A form of determinative economic influence that enables a corporation to be in a position to impose its will on the affairs of another corporation is sufficient to constitute de facto control.

[36] The respondent maintains that the appellant was operationally and economically dependent on Solutions MindReady inc. so that it was able to exert the type of pressure that allowed it to impose its will on the appellant’s affairs.

[37] The partial agreement on the facts, the documentary evidence submitted by the parties and the testimonial evidence provided by the witnesses at the hearing show that

(a) operationally, the influence factors exercised by Solutions MindReady inc. over the appellant include the following:

(i) all of the corporations in the group of corporations controlled by Solutions MindReady inc. were managed by the same people;

(ii) Solutions MindReady inc. and the appellant occupied the same premises and shared the same employees;

(iii) the employees transferred to the appellant saw no changes in their tasks, their workplace or the research projects they worked on;

(iv) according to the organizational charts submitted by Solutions MindReady inc. to illustrate its corporate structure, the Fiducie financière Solutions MindReady and the appellant are an integral part of Solutions MindReady inc. and appear to be its subsidiaries;

(v) according to the Annual Information Form of Solutions MindReady inc. dated March 31, 2006, the appellant is described as a subsidiary 100% owned by Solutions MindReady inc. as of December 31, 2005.

(vi) the bookkeeping for all of the entities in the MindReady group was done by the accountants of Solutions MindReady inc.;

(vii) Marc Lamy authorized fund transfers between the various entities of the MindReady group;

(viii) no agreement was offered in evidence to justify recharging the cost of services provided by the appellant’s employees to Solutions MindReady inc. In addition, invoices issued by the appellant do not match the transactions performed in its bank accounts.

(ix) the salaries of employees assigned to research and development activities were paid by the appellant in Canadian dollars every two weeks from its bank account. That money came from transfers made directly by Solutions MindReady inc. The first million dollars, which was used to subscribe to 999,900 class B shares of the appellant, was never used to pay the salary of employees working in research and development.

and that

(b) Economically, the influence factors exercised by Solutions MindReady inc. over the appellant include the following:

(i) the appellant had only one client, namely, Solutions MindReady inc.;

(ii) Solutions MindReady inc. guaranteed a loan of $650,000 taken out by the appellant;

(iii) external auditors consolidated the appellant’s financial statements with those of Solutions MindReady inc.;

(iv) according to the research contract between Solutions MindReady inc. and the appellant, research work to be done by the appellant was determined by Solutions MindReady inc., and it kept the intellectual property rights arising from it;

(v) the royalties and revenues earned from the issuing of licences were clearly insufficient to offset the cost of the research expenses. During the first five months of the appellant’s operation, the net deposits in the appellant’s two bank accounts totalled $2,800,000 (including the initial share subscription of $1,000,000), while the royalties generated by the appellant’s research activities totalled only $50,000;

(vi) the appellant would not have been able to carry out its research and development activities without the advances of funds from Solutions MindReady inc.;

(vii) the bankruptcy of Solutions MindReady inc. resulted in the sale of some of the appellant’s assets, namely, its tax credits for scientific research and experimental development.

[38] On the basis of the operational and economic influence factors listed at sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 37, I can only find that Solutions MindReady inc. exercised de facto control over the appellant. During the taxation years at issue, the appellant was completely economically dependent on Solutions MindReady inc.

[39] Considering the finding on the first issue, which disposes of this appeal, and the circumstances of this case, it is not necessary to consider the alternative argument raised by the respondent.

[40] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
