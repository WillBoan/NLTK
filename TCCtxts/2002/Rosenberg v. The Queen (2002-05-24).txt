Background

[5] The Appellant and Nanci Pach were married in September 1983. By 1994, the marriage had floundered and the Appellant and Pach were in the process of separating. At this point of time, the Appellant was still resident in the family home and was being urged to move out. At or about the same time, the mortgage on the family home (title to which was in Pach's name) came up for renewal and Pach refused to execute any of the relevant documents until the Appellant agreed to leave. This impasse led to the drafting of the separation agreement (the agreement) and the reciprocal execution of the mortgage documents followed by the Appellant's move out of the residence. The agreement dated April 17, 1994 provides as follows:

I, Bruce Rosenberg, agree to pay the mortgage payments for 137 Westmorland Ave., Toronto, after separation from Nanci Pach up until a period of five years or until Nanci Pach releases me in writing. I also agree to give $1,000.00 support per month & monthly expenses for 137 Westmorland Ave., including realty taxes, hydro, gas, telephone, insurance, cable, auto expenses (including gas, insurance), domestic help & other expenses not expressly listed.



I also acknowledge that I declined to list or verbally state an interest in taking any property i.e. furniture when invited to do so for Nanci Pach instead I leave such allocation responsibilities to Nanci Pach.



Dated at Toronto, this 17th day of April, 1994.



Witness:



"Nanci Pach"



"Bruce Rosenberg"

[6] According to the Appellant, the agreement was designed to confirm their mutual understanding that, because Pach had no source of income at that particular time, he would shoulder all of the financial burdens of maintaining the family until Pach was in a position to take responsibility for some of it. Her testimony confirmed that the agreement required the Appellant to provide support in the amounts set out therein. However, she maintained that the Appellant's direct payments of the household expenses were always intended to be an interim measure designed to enable her to "get my feet back on the ground". Accordingly, as agreed, during the initial stage Pach received $1,000 per month directly while other expenses enumerated in the agreement were paid by the Appellant. Some three or four months after the agreement was executed, she insisted that it was time to "have the payments come directly to me so that I can be self-sufficient". Pach was very clear that the payments she referred to reflected the expenses necessary to maintain the customary style of living of the family. In her words: "whatever cost it cost him to run the house for the three months, that's what I would require". The Appellant agreed and from that point on in accordance with their agreement, the amounts required were paid directly to her.[1] The sole exception reflected the third party payments most of which he continued to make in both 1997 and 1998.[2]

[7] The Appellant testified that in 1997 his law practice was not doing well and the payments had become a burden. He says that in or about January 1998, Pach agreed to lower the payments to $3,200 per month less an agreed deduction for certain other payments such as her income tax, car insurance, house insurance, etc. The Appellant maintains this was reduced to writing but no document was produced. Pach, for her part, denies that any such agreement, oral or written, took place. The examination and cross-examination on this issue consumed a good deal of time but produced little information of value and, on balance, fell short of establishing the existence of a new or amended agreement. In any event, the parties do not dispute that any such agreement would have affected the amount only and not the underlying basis upon which the payments were being made pursuant to the 1994 agreement.

Analysis

[8] The first question: Were the amounts paid by the Appellant to Pach or to third parties paid pursuant to a written agreement?

The evidence clearly establishes that the terms set out in the agreement were understood and accepted by both parties. It was suggested by counsel for Pach that her lack of experience and knowledge regarding tax matters led her to accept the terms without realizing their full consequences. I am unable to agree. Pach is an intelligent and articulate young woman and in the course of her testimony demonstrated, in my view, an adequate appreciation not only of the amount required for the support of herself and the children, but also the firm conviction that the amounts were to be paid to her directly so that she could exercise her discretion as to their disposition. I am satisfied the document filed as Exhibit A-4 cannot be construed as anything other than a written recording of the support payments agreed upon by the Appellant and Pach.

[9] The second and third questions: Are the amounts paid by Rosenberg to Pach or paid to third parties deductible by him pursuant to paragraph 60(b) and subsections 60.1(1) and 60.1(2) of the Act and thus, are they to be included in computing Pach's income pursuant to paragraph 56(1)(b) and subsections 56.1(1) and 56.1(2) of the Act?

Position of the Joined Party, Nanci Pach

[10] (a) Relying on the provisions of subsection 56.1(4) and the definitions of "support amount" and "child support amount", her counsel argued that "in order to be deductible, the amount must be expressed and identified as solely for the support of the spouse".[3] These definitions, he argued, make it clear that since the amounts set out in the agreement were not identified as being payable as an allowance to the spouse, then it becomes a "child support amount" and is not deductible to the Appellant. On this basis, counsel contends that the Appellant is only entitled to deduct the amount of $4,000 in 1997[4] and is not entitled to any deduction in 1998.

(b) Counsel further argued that the only limited and predetermined amount of support paid pursuant to the agreement was the $1,000 fixed amount and contends that there being no limitation as to the balance the amounts of which are neither specified nor quantified, they are not allowable as a deduction for the purposes of the Act.

(c) It was further submitted that the specific third party payments itemized in paragraphs 21 to 25, 27 and 28 of the Agreed Statement of Facts are not deductible since that required an express reference to subsections 60.1(2) and 56.1(2) in the agreement. Since they are not referred to in the agreement, the third party payments must be shown to be a support amount and given the evidence, counsel argued that they were not.

Analysis

[11] Before dealing with the submissions advanced on behalf of Pach, the question whether the deductions claimed by the Appellant can be supported by the provisions of subsection 60.1(2) of the Act must be considered. This subsection and its alter ego, subsection 56.1(2), mandates that the agreement must have in it clear and unequivocal language from which it can be taken that both parties to the agreement meant that the amount in issue would be tax deductible and tax includable. The agreement in issue does not utilize the statutory language required by subsection 60.1(2) and thus it has no application. Since there is no specific language nor implicit statements in the agreement as required by the Act,[5] the response to the first part of question two is that the Appellant is not entitled to a deduction based on the provisions in subsection 60.1(2).

[12] The first issue raised on behalf of Pach is that the amounts paid were "child support amounts" and thus not deductible to the Appellant. The definitions relied upon by her counsel form part of amendments made by 1998 c. 19, subsection 97(2) applicable to amounts received after 1996. In order to determine the tax treatment of a support payment received after 1996, it is necessary to find that the amount constitutes a "support amount" or a "child support amount" as defined in subsection 56.1(4). By virtue of this subsection after 1996 the term "child support amount" means any support amount that is not identified in the agreement as being solely for the support of the spousal recipient. Although there is no mention or reference to the children in the agreement before this Court it would be difficult to argue that the payments were made solely for the support of Pach. Thus, the amounts paid are, by definition, a "child support amount" and pursuant to the 1998 amendment, would not be taxable to the recipient or deductible to the payer. However, that is not the end of the matter since the argument advanced does not take into account the fact that although the "child support amounts" in issue were received after 1996, the agreement between the parties predates the amending legislation. To be subtracted in accordance with the formula in paragraph 56(1)(b) of the Act, the "child support amount" must be one that became receivable under an agreement on or after its "commencement day". The legislation also provides that the "child support amount" does not include an amount that was received under a written agreement that does not have a "commencement day" as that term is defined in the Act.[6] For orders and agreements made before May 1997, the prior provisions apply. Thus, in applying the formula set out in paragraph 56(1)(b), "child support amounts" receivable under pre-May 1997 Orders without a "commencement day" are not to be included in B of the formula and would not reduce the total support amounts described in A of paragraph 56(1)(b).[7] In such cases, "child support amounts" continue to be includable in computing the recipient's income.

[13] Counsel for Pach further contends that the payments made, other than the $1,000 fixed amount, were neither predetermined nor limited. Although the evidence is not as clear and precise as it might have been, I am unable to reach the same conclusion. Although the balance of the support payments over and above the $1,000 fixed amount were not specifically quantified in the agreement, the evidence indicates that they were thoroughly discussed and by the very nature of the expenses were in a general sense predetermined and limited. I refer particularly to the Appellant's testimony that they "talked about the amounts to be paid directly per month" and his recollection that "it was generally a set amount in the neighbourhood, around $3,200". Furthermore, Pach does not dispute that direct payments of $3,200 and $3,000 per month were made to her in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Furthermore, the cheques provided to Pach by the Appellant on a regular basis were payable to her and were not directed or intended to be used for a particular payment. Indeed, the evidence is clear that as the recipient of these cheques, Pach was not in any manner precluded from exercising her discretion in allocating the funds available to her to specific accounts or deciding when or if they were to be paid. Since these child support amounts arise from an agreement that does not have a "commencement day", they do not reduce the total support amounts described in clause 60(b)(A) of the Act.[8]

[14] The last issue to be considered is whether the payments made by the Appellant to third parties in the 1997 and 1998 taxation years were made on account of "support payments" to Pach within the meaning of paragraph 60(b) of the Act. The agreement itself does not directly or by inference allow the Appellant to fulfil his obligation thereunder by making payments to third parties. As well, the evidence adduced by him falls short of establishing that those payments were made with the express consent of Pach. His testimony in this context was equivocal at best, leaving the Court with the distinct impression that it was more a matter of convenience to the Appellant. It is not possible on the evidence before me to conclude that these payments were made at Pach's discretion or that she had given express consent thereto. I conclude that the payments made to third parties in the 1997 and 1998 taxation years were not support payments within paragraph 60(b) of the Act.

J.T.C.C.

[1] Although the Appellant made the payments on an irregular basis to accommodate his cash flow needs, it is not disputed that direct payments of $3,200 and $3,000 per month were made to her in 1997 and 1998, respectively. See also Exhibit A-18 - letter from Pach's solicitor to the Appellant includes the following comment: "After separation, your client had agreed to pay child support to my client in the form of $3,000 cash per month, payment of the mortgage on the house, payment of my client's income taxes arising from the inclusion of the cash support". Although the evidence is not precise, it appears that at the insistence of Pach, the responsibility for the payments of the mortgage were transferred to her at some point of time in 1998.

[2] The third party payments are set out in paragraphs 21 to 25, 27 and 28 of the Agreed Statement of Facts.

[3] 56.1(4) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section and section 56.



"support amount" means an amount payable or receivable as an allowance on a periodic basis for the maintenance of the recipient, children of the recipient or both the recipient and children of the recipient, if the recipient has discretion as to the use of the amount, and



(a) the recipient is the spouse or common-law partner or former spouse or common-law partner of the payer, the recipient and payer are living separate and apart because of the breakdown of their marriage or common-law partnership and the amount is receivable under an order of a competent tribunal or under a written agreement; or

(b) the payer is a natural parent of a child of the recipient and the amount is receivable under an order made by a competent tribunal in accordance with the laws of a province.



"child support amount" means any support amount that is not identified in the agreement or order under which it is receivable as being solely for the support of a recipient who is a spouse or common-law partner or former spouse or common-law partner of the payer or who is a parent of a child of whom the payer is a natural parent.

60.1(4) The definitions in subsection 56.1(4) apply in this section and section 60.

[4] i.e. $1,000 per month for each of January to April, 1997, inclusive, being the four months preceding the "commencement day" as defined in subsection 56.1(4).

[5] The specific language of 60.1(2)(b) is as follows: shall, where the decree, order, judgment, or written agreement, as the case may be, provides that this subsection and subsection 56.1(2) shall apply to any payment made thereunder, be deemed to be an amount paid by the taxpayer and received by that person as an allowance payable on a periodic basis.

[6] 56.1(4) "commencement day" at any time of an agreement or order means

(a) where the agreement or order is made after April 1997, the day it is made; and

(b) where the agreement or order is made before May 1997, the day, if any, that is after April 1997 and is the earliest of

(i) the day specified as the commencement day of the agreement or order by the payer and recipient under the agreement or order in a joint election filed with the Minister in prescribed form and manner,

(ii) where the agreement or order is varied after April 1997 to change the child support amounts payable to the recipient, the day on which the first payment of the varied amount is required to be made,

(iii) where a subsequent agreement or order is made after April 1997, the effect of which is to change the total child support amounts payable to the recipient by the payer, the commencement day of the first such subsequent agreement or order, and

(iv) the day specified in the agreement or order, or any variation thereof, as the commencement day of the agreement or order for the purposes of this Act.

[7] 56(1) Without restricting the generality of section 3, there shall be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year,

...

(b) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount determined by the formula

A - (B + C)

where

A is the total of all amounts each of which is a support amount received after 1996 and before the end of the year by the taxpayer from a particular person where the taxpayer and the particular person were living separate and apart at the time the amount was received,

B is the total of all amounts each of which is a child support amount that became receivable by the taxpayer from the particular person under an agreement or order on or after its commencement day and before the end of the year in respect of a period that began on or after its commencement day, and

C is the total of all amounts each of which is a support amount received after 1996 by the taxpayer from the particular person and included in the taxpayer's income for a preceding taxation year;

[8] 60 There may be deducted in computing a taxpayer's income for a taxation year such of the following amounts as are applicable:

(b) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount determined by the formula

A - (B + C)
