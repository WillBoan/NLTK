BETWEEN:

CAMBRIDGE ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS INC.,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

Reasonsfor Judgment

Beaubier, J.T.C.C.

[1] This appeal pursuant to the General Procedure was heard at Edmonton, Alberta on April 24 and 25, 2002. The Appellant called Monty Donaldson, a former officer and director of the Appellant, of Skimmer Oil Separators Ltd. ("Skimmer"), of Western Oil Processors Ltd. ("Processors"), of Western Oil Disposal Wells Ltd. ("Disposal") of 731059 Alberta Ltd. ("731059") and of Soiltech Environmental Systems Canada Inc. ("Soiltech"). The Respondent did not call any witnesses, but read in parts of the examination for discovery of Mr. Donaldson.

[2] Two issues are in dispute. The first - whether the Appellant is entitled to disputed input tax credits - was settled by a "Notice of Agreement" filed in Court on April 25, 2002 which is attached hereto. The appeal is allowed pursuant to the agreement and the matter is referred to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment pursuant to that agreement.

[3] The second matter in dispute is what the consideration was for the waste disposal licence issued by the Alberta Energy Utilities Board ("AEUB") described as WM014. This licence allowed the operation of a waste disposal plant for oilfield waste products. The plant was located near Marwayne, Alberta and the licence granted a monopoly on gathering and disposing of oilfield waste production over a geographic area to be served by that plant. The trial itself only dealt with this issue.

[4] The parties filed an agreement of general facts respecting the dispute which reads:

[5] An outline of facts in dispute is contained in the following assumptions from the Reply to the Notice of Appeal which were not refuted by the evidence. They are assumptions 12 b) to m) inclusive and 12 s) to v) inclusive.

They read as follows:

12. In so assessing the Appellant, the Minster relied on, inter alia, the following assumptions of fact:

...

c) at all material times, the Appellant was a Canadian-based public company listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange ("VSE");

t) the Appellant and Newalta were acting at arm's length;

u) the value of the consideration for the Licence was $349,999;

v) the GST arising from this transaction was $24,773.

[6] The Appellant's counsel was at pains in his argument and presentation of evidence to blame the chartered accountants who prepared the Appellant's financial statements for an "error" which resulted in this assessment. In fact, the assessment and the financial statements prepared by the accountants follow logically and legally from the actual documents and agreements executed by the Appellant respecting the licence. Because it may also relate to other matters, that chain will be outlined here. However the outline given by the Court is merely an exposition of the written argument filed by the Respondent's counsel. At the outset, it should be stated that the Appellant argued that the Appellant owned the licence in trust for Skimmer. There is no evidence whatsoever of any such trust relation by the Appellant or of any agreement between the two that a trust would or did exist.

[7] On June 1, 1994 the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (the predecessor to the AEUB) granted licence WM014 to the Appellant (Exhibit A-1, Tab 1). The Appellant accepted licence WM014. The first four paragraphs of that grant outline the background of that grant to the Appellant. They read:

WHEREAS the Energy Resources Conservation Board, by Approval No. CW4708, granted approval to Skimmer Oil Separators Ltd. to construct and operate a waste processing and disposal facility as described in the application dated 29 October 1986; and

WHEREAS Cambridge Environmental Systems Inc. acquired Skimmer Oil Separators Ltd. and then submitted additional information on their Marwayne facility; and

WHEREAS the Board deems it desirable that a new approval be issued to replace Approval No. CW4708, subject to the terms and the conditions herein contained.

THEREFORE the Energy Resources Conservation Board, pursuant to the Oil and Gas Conservation Act, being chapter 0-5 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1980, hereby grants to Cambridge Environmental Systems Inc. (herein after called "Cambridge") approval to operate an oilfield waste management facility located in Legal Subdivision 14 of Section 31, Township 51, Range 2 West of the 4th Meridian, as described in the submission dated 23 March 1994 and the addendum dated 9 May 1994 and are subject to the following terms and conditions;

[8] Skimmer had granted the licence as security respecting monies received from both Alberta Treasury Branch and Western Economic Diversification. When they discovered (at an unknown date) that the Appellant had acquired licence WM014, which allowed the plant to operate, they demanded that it be returned to Skimmer. The Appellant first acted on this demand on January 31, 1996. There is no evidence that the licence was ever put in Skimmer's name or title after it was granted to the Appellant on June 1, 1994. Moreover, the clarity of the licence as quoted would clearly bring to the Appellant's attention the fact that its licence WM014 had replaced Skimmer's old licence. On this basis the Court finds that the Appellant knew after June 1, 1994 that it owned licence WM014 and the Appellant kept it for its own purposes and benefit. The licence itself was never specifically recorded as an asset of Skimmer or of the Appellant in any of their financial statements except in the financial statement attached to its income tax return for the year ending June 30, 1997. That is described in paragraph [12] herein.

[9] On May 2, 1997 the Appellant and 731059 agreed to sell assets, including licence WM014 to Newalta Corporation ("Newalta"), (Exhibit A-1, Tab 3). Paragraph 4 states that "Cambridge would assign or consent to the assignment of the licence directly to Newalta" (referring to licence WM014).

[10] "As of" 4 June, 1997, Cambridge, 731059 and Newalta signed an "Amending Agreement" to the May 22, 1997 agreement which agrees in paragraph 2 that the purchase price shall be allocated to the "licence" in the sum of $349,999.

[11] "As of the 4th day of June, 1997" Cambridge and Newalta executed a further assignment agreement (Exhibit R-1, Tab 5) which states, in full:

THIS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT MADE AS OF THE 4TH DAY OF JUNE, 1997.

OF THE SECOND PART

WHEREAS Cambridge is approved to operate an oilfield waste management facility by the Alberta Energy Utility Board ("AEUB") under the provisions of The Oil and Gas Conservation Act being License #WM014, as amended on November 10, 1994 and November 18, 1994 and as further amended pursuant to AEUB Miscellaneous Order 95099 dated January 3, 1996 as amended on July 25, 1996 and September 27, 1996 (the "Cambridge Operating Authority");

NOW WITNESSETH IN CONSIDERATION of the sum of ONE ($1.00) DOLLAR and other consideration set out in an agreement dated May 22, 1997, as amended, the parties agree as follows:

1. Cambridge hereby represents and warrants to Newalta that it is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Cambridge Operating Authority and it is entitled to assign same as here contemplated free and clear of all liens, charges and encumbrances.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have executed this Assignment Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

NEWALTA CORPORATION

PER: _____"signature"_________________________

[12] Thereupon Cambridge filed its income tax return for the year ending June 30, 1997 (signed by Mr. Donaldson) in which it recorded "Gain on sale of Skimmer license" as $349,999.

[13] The evidence is clear that the Appellant owned licence WM014 and sold it to Newalta for $349,999 as agreed on May 22, 1997 and June 4, 1997. The parties were at arm's length and so agreed. The Appellant itself set all of those facts out clearly in writing. The appeal respecting this issue is dismissed.

[14] The Respondent is awarded party and party costs for this proceeding.
