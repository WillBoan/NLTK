Reasons for Judgment

Little, J.

A. FACTS

[1] The Appellant has had experience working in the tool and dye industry.

[2] In the 1997 and 1998 taxation years the Appellant maintains that he was operating a business under the name "Timo Enterprises" ("Enterprises").

[3] The Appellant's spouse owned and operated a physiotherapy clinic under the name "East Scarborough Physiotherapy" (the "Clinic").

[4] During the 1997 and 1998 taxation years the Appellant worked for the Clinic performing front desk and other duties for the Clinic.

[5] In the 1997 and 1998 taxation years the Clinic issued T-4A forms for the Appellant as follows:

Income

1997

$7,800.00

1998

14,560.00

The Appellant reported the above amounts as employment income in determining his income for the 1997 and 1998 taxation years.

[6] In the 1997 and 1998 taxation years the Appellant also received the following amounts from the Clinic:

Additional Income

1997

$16,250.00

1998

$20,900.00

[7] The Appellant maintains that the additional income was the income of Enterprises. The Appellant also deducted expenses in determining the income of Enterprises. Enterprises reported income as follows:

1997

1998

Income

$16,250.00

$20,900.00

Expenses

12,653.57

14,046.73

Net Income

$3,596.43

$6,853.27

[8] The Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") issued Notices of Assessment for the Appellant's 1997 and 1998 taxation years and the income of Timo Enterprises was accepted as filed.

[9] Subsequent to the issuance of the assessments the Appellant requested that the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency allow Timo Enterprises additional expenses as follows:

1997

1998

Additional Expenses

$914.25

$2,688.24

[10] On the 15th day of April, 2001 the Minister issued Notices of Reassessment for the Appellant's 1997 and 1998 taxation years. In the reassessments the Minister disallowed the expenses of $12,653.57 and $14,046.73 originally claimed by the Appellant for the 1997 and 1998 years respectively. In the said reassessments the Minister also denied the additional expenses in the amount of $914.25 and $2,688.24 that were claimed by the Appellant.

B. ISSUES

(1) Did the Appellant operate a business under the name of "Timo Enterprises" in the 1997 and 1998 taxation years?

(2) If Timo Enterprises was carrying on a business in the 1997 and 1998 taxation years, is Timo Enterprises allowed to deduct the expenses that were claimed?

C. ANALYSIS

[11] I have considered the testimony of the Appellant and I have concluded that in the 1997 and 1998 taxation years he was operating a business under the name of "Timo Enterprises". It therefore follows that the amounts of $16,250.00 and $20,900.00 received in the 1997 and 1998 taxation years respectively constituted business income. In reaching this conclusion I have noted the pieces of equipment manufactured by Timo Enterprises for the Clinic. (See Exhibit A-8.) I have also heard the Appellant's testimony that he attempted to develop new business for Timo Enterprises by advertising and by personal contact with other Physiotherapists. (Note: to determine whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business in a taxation year we must examine the relevant facts in that particular taxation year.)

[12] We must now determine the expenses that may be deducted by "Timo Enterprises".

[13] I have concluded that the following expenses are deductible in determining the business income of Timo Enterprises:

1997 Taxation Year

Home Insurance 50% - $ 280.06 25% - $ 140.03

Signed at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 10th day of September, 2002.
