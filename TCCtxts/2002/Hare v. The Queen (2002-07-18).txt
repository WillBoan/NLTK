Respondent.

AMENDED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Little, J.

[1] The above appeals were heard on July 10, 2002 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

[2] On July 23, 2002 Reasons for Judgment were issued allowing the appeals in part.

[3] On July 29, 2002 Michael Taylor, counsel for the Respondent, wrote to the Court. In his letter Mr. Taylor requested clarification from the Court on the following issues:

Issue No. 1:

Mr. Taylor noted that the Respondent conceded during the trial that the following amounts should be deleted from the Appellant's income for purposes of the appeal filed under the Income Tax Act and Goods and Services Tax imposed by the Excise Tax Act:

1996 - $1,040.92

1997 $1,624.10

Conclusion:

[4] The Reasons for Judgment issued on the 23rd day of July 2002 should be amended to delete the amounts of $1,040.92 and $1,624.10 from the Appellant's income for the 1996 and 1997 taxation years respectively. The deductions should be allowed under the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act.

Issue No. 2:

Mr. Taylor in his letter noted that in the Reasons for Judgment issued under the Excise Tax Act the Court ordered that the Minister delete penalties imposed under the Excise Tax Act. Mr. Taylor pointed out that the only penalties imposed were imposed under section 280 of the Excise Tax Act. Mr. Taylor requested clarification as to whether the Court has made a finding of due diligence.

Penalties were imposed under section 280 of the Excise Tax Act because it was the view of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency that Mr. Hare had failed to report all of his income under the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act.

I have concluded that the Appellant attempted to comply with the Excise Tax Act and in my opinion there is no basis for the penalties that were imposed under section 280 of the Excise Tax Act. I therefore order that the penalties imposed under section 280 of the Act be cancelled.

Signed at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 11th day of October 2002.
