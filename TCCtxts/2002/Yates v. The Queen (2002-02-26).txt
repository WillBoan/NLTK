Reasonsfor Order

(Delivered orally from the Bench at Toronto, Ontario, on February 18, 2002)

McArthur J.

[1] I made a remark with regard to your being a lawyer which may have sounded flippant. Obviously there is a higher standard imposed upon you because of your educational background, yet I am prepared to grant your application for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal from assessments of tax made under the Income Tax Act for the 1996 and 1997 taxation years. What tips the balance is that it would appear that you have reasonable grounds for appeal and the matter should be tried on its merits rather than to dismiss the appeals for your not complying with the Rules of the Court.

[2] Further, I believe the Applicant's evidence. While there was a lag of eight months before making the application, I understand he had not received the letter from Canada Customs & Revenue Agency which would have clearly set out his responsibilities under subsection 169(1) of the Act.

[3] With respect to the merits of his appeals, expense receipts are important but, not obligatory. I would urge the Minister of National Revenue and the Applicant to talk with a view of arriving at a reasonable settlement, if such is possible. So as far as the procedure is concerned we will consider the Notice of Appeal dated October 4, 2000 filed as of this date.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 3rd day of April, 2002.
