Docket: 2002-984-IT-I

BETWEEN:

CORRADO MORANA,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

Reasons for Judgment

(delivered orally from the bench at

Toronto, Ontario, on September 11, 2002)

O'Connor, J.T.C.C.

[1] I accept the credibility of the Appellant. I am influenced by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Stewart v. Canada, [2002] S.C.J. No. 46 with respect to reasonable expectation of profit.

[2] I sincerely believe that the Appellant's experience and interest in the audio and musical fields should not be a prejudice against him.

[3] I believe his was conducting at lest two separate businesses as a source of income and I must admit I do have difficulty with some of the expenses which have been claimed. Rather than examining a McDonald's bill for $1.60 and all of the other bills that have been submitted, I am suggesting that the offer of the Appellant to a certain compromise should be accepted.

[4] Consequently, my judgment is that the appeals from the reassessments made under the Income Tax Act for the 1998 and 1999 taxation years are allowed, with costs, and the reassessments are referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment to the extent only that the total income tax liability regarding the Sound Studio for the years 1998 and 1999 and the Public Paralegal-Public Process Servers for the year 1999, being the businesses, the expenses of which were in issue, shall be $3,000.00.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 29th day of October, 2002.
