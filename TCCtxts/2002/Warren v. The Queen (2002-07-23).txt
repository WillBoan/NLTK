Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

Reasons for judgment

Little, J.

A. FACTS

[1] The Appellant is the spouse of Dennis Michael Warren ("Dennis").

[2] Dennis operated a trucking business as a proprietorship ("The Business"). Commencing in 1992 Dennis changed the nature of his business from a trucking business to the business of a logging contractor. Dennis operated as a logging contractor from 1992 until serious financial problems forced him to discontinue The Business in 1998.

[3] Until August 1, 1998 the Appellant and Dennis owned, as joint tenants, homes located at the following addresses:

- 1695 Pine Grove Street, Lillooet, B.C.

- 6490 Jones Road, Savona, B.C.

(the homes noted above are referred to as "The Properties").

[4] The Appellant provided various services to The Business. The Appellant operated the office, prepared the payroll, maintained the books, picked-up parts required to repair the extensive logging equipment, provided cooking and housekeeping to employees of The Business and provided other assistance to The Business.

[5] The Appellant reported employment income from The Business as follows:

1992 $32,000.00

1993 $7,500.00

1994 $7,500.00

1995 $15,000.00

1996 $10,000.00

1997 --

1998 $6,000.00

The Appellant testified that after the tax was paid on this income, the amount remaining was lent by the Appellant to Dennis for use in The Business.

[6] The Appellant testified that she also lent additional money from her personal funds to The Business.

[7] Dennis testified that on August 5, 1998 he repaid the loan that he owed to the Appellant by transferring his equity in The Properties to the Appellant.

[8] As a result of a series of financial problems beyond the control of Dennis, The Business was unable to pay the applicable Goods and Service Tax ("GST").

[9] On March 28, 2000, the Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") reassessed the Appellant to impose GST of $85,669.83 pursuant to subsection 325(1) of the Excise Tax Act (the "Act"). The GST imposed by the Minister on the Appellant was later reduced to $71,500.00. In issuing the Notice of Assessment the Minister determined that at the time of the transfer by Dennis of his equity in The Properties to the Appellant, the value of the equity owned by Dennis in The Properties was not less than $71,500.00.

B. ISSUE

[10] The issue is whether the Appellant is jointly and severally liable with Dennis pursuant to subsection 325(1) of the Act for the GST in the amount of $71,500.00.

C. ANALYSIS

[11] The sworn testimony of the Appellant and Dennis supported by the testimony of the accountant, Mr. Sellmer, C.A., establishes that in the years indicated the Appellant made the following loans to Dennis and received the indicated repayments from Dennis.

Loan

Year Amount Repayments Amount Owing

1992 $28,166.34 $10,735.17 $17,431.17

1993 $ 8,678.14 $15,120.51 < $6,442.37 >

1994 $24,465.03 $14,882.15 $ 9,582.88

1995 $38,806.80 $25,592.68 $13,214.12

1996 $11,800.00 $18,256.11 < $6,456.11 >

1997 $40,359.60 $ 6,445.86 $33,913.74

1998* $11,310.98 $34,337.51 < $23,026.53 >

Balance $38,216.90

*to August 5th, 1998

[12] I have carefully considered the testimony of the Appellant, the testimony of Dennis, the testimony of Mr. Sellmer and the supporting documents filed with the Court. I have concluded that Dennis owed the Appellant at least $38,216.90 prior to the transfer by Dennis of his equity in The Properties to the Appellant.

[13] The appeal is to be allowed and the Minister is instructed to reduce the G.S.T. of $71,500.00 assessed against the Appellant by deducting therefrom the amount of $38,216.90. There will be no further adjustments to the Notice of Reassessment.
