and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Reasons for Judgment

Little, J.

A. FACTS

[1] In 1996 the Appellant established a business of leasing snowmobiles in Yorkton, Saskatchewan. The Appellant purchased snowmobiles and leased the snowmobiles to various customers on a daily or weekly basis.

[2] From 1996 to 1999 the Appellant reported rental income, expenses and losses as follows:

Income Expenses Losses

1996 $ 2,739.00 $ 3,902.00 ($ 1,163.00)

1997 6,593.00 11,713.00 ( 5,120.00)

1998 5,675.00 11,507.52 ( 5,832.52)

1999 4,716.28 14,417.19 ( 9,700.91)

[3] Because of the continual losses suffered by the Appellant the snowmobile rental business was discontinued in 2002.

[4] The Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") reassessed the Appellant's 1998 and 1999 taxation years.

[5] In reassessing the Appellant's 1998 taxation year the Minister disallowed the business loss of $5,832.52.

[6] In reassessing the Appellant's 1999 taxation year the Minister reduced the business loss claimed by the Appellant from $9,700.91 to a business loss of $744.54.

B. ISSUE

[7] Is the Appellant entitled to deduct business losses of $5,832.52 and $9,700.91 in determining his income for the 1998 and 1999 taxation years respectively?

C. ANALYSIS

[8] The Appellant testified that in the 1998 and 1999 taxation years he incurred various expenses in an attempt to establish a profitable snowmobile rental business.

[9] I have carefully considered the Appellant's testimony and I have concluded that the following additional expenses should be allowed:

AMOUNTS TO BE ALLOWED

Expenses: 1998 1999

Advertising $ 42.80

Meals and Entertainment - $ 149.45

Office Expenses 1,214.95

Supplies 1,238.72

Travel 75.82 503.05

[10] With respect to capital cost allowance the following items should be added to the C.C.A. Schedule with no personal element recognized:

Computer $ 1,135.50

Garage Heater 1,916.13

Cellular Telephone 399.00

[11] I believe that the Minister is correct in moving the garage heater from Class 8 to Class 1.

[12] The Minister of National Revenue is instructed to reassess the Appellant's 1998 and 1999 taxation years to allow the amountS as noted above.
