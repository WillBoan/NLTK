BETWEEN:

ESTATE OF JOHN HOMERSHAM,

Appellant,

and



HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

Reasonsfor Judgment



Beaubier, J.T.C.C.

[1] This appeal pursuant to the Informal Procedure was heard at Regina, Saskatchewan on June 26, 2002. The Appellant's accountant, Jim Chow, C.M.A. testified. The Respondent called the auditor on the file, William Peake.

[2] At the hearing, the Appellant was represented by a lawyer and henceforth the address for service of the Appellant is his address, namely:

Glen Dowling

Robb & Dowling

Ste 4 - 2305 Victoria Avenue

Regina, Saskatchewan

S4P 0S7

[3] The positions of the parties are set out in paragraphs 2 to 6 inclusive of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal. They read:

2. The 1996, 1997 and 1998 income tax returns were initially assessed by the Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") on June 25, 1998, June 22, 1998 and June 7, 1999.



3. In computing income for the 1996, 1997 and 1998 Taxation Years, the Appellant reported taxable capital gains ("TCG") in the amounts of $12,529, $46,535 and $9,506 respectively.



4. In reassessing the Appellant for the 1996, 1997 and 1998 Taxation Years, the Minister added TCG in the amounts of $8,059, $3,575 and $6,572 respectively.



5. In so reassessing the Appellant, the Minister made the following assumptions of fact:



(a) the Appellant received a T3 information slip from the Public Trustee in the 1996 Taxation Year showing capital gains in the amount of $27,449.72;



(b) the Taxable portion of the capital gain for the 1996 Taxation Year is $27,449.72 x 75% = $20,587.29;



(c) the Appellant claimed a capital loss in the 1996 Taxation Year calculated as follows:



Public Trustee: Proceeds of Disposition 16,704.89

Adjusted Cost Base 27,449.72

Capital Loss (10,744.83)



(d) the Appellant reported a TCG of $12,528.67 in the 1996 Taxation Year calculated as follows:



Capital Gain 27,449.72

Capital Loss (10,744.83)

Net Capital Gain 16,704.89

Taxable Portion 75% 12,528.57



(e) the Appellant failed to report TCG of $8,059 in the 1996 Taxation Year;



(f) the Appellant received a T3 information slip from the Public Trustee in the 1997 Taxation Year showing capital gains in the amount of $14,235.75;



(g) the Taxable portion of the capital gain for the 1997 Taxation Year is $14,235.75 x 75% = $10,676.81;



(h) the Appellant claimed a capital loss in the 1997 Taxation Year calculated as follows:



Public Trustee: Proceeds of Disposition 9,468.65

Adjusted Cost Base 14,235.75

Capital Loss ( 4,767.10)



(i) the Appellant reported a TCG of $46,534.72 in the 1997 Taxation Year calculated as follows:



Capital Gain Per T3

14,235.75

Capital Gain (Land)

52,577.64

Capital Loss

( 4,767.10)

Net Capital Gain

62,046.29

Taxable Port 75%

46,534.72



(j) the Appellant failed to report TCG of $3,575 in the 1997 Taxation Year



(k) the Appellant received a T3 information slip from the Public Trustee in the 1998 Taxation Year showing capital gains in the amount of $21,437.84;



(l) the Taxable portion of the capital gain for the 1998 Taxation year is $21,437.84 x 75% = $16,078.38;



(m) the Appellant reported a TCG of $9,506.22 in the 1998 Taxation Year calculated as follows:



Capital Gain 12,674.96

Taxable Portion 75% 9,506.22

(n) the Appellant failed to report TCG of $6,572 in the 1998 Taxation Year



B. ISSUES TO BE DECIDED



6. The issue is whether the Minister has correctly calculated the amount of Taxable Capital Gains to be included in the Appellants income in the 1996, 1997 and 1998 Taxation Years.



[4] However, the essential point of the appeal of the assessments is that the estate's accountant filed income tax returns for the years in question on the basis that the T-3 slips received by the Appellant from the Public Trustee of Saskatchewan were for more total money than the Appellant received from the Public Trustee. A summary is set out by Exhibit A-4 prepared by Mr. Chow. It reads:

[5] The Respondent assessed on the basis of the T-3's. Revenue Canada also wrote a letter to the Public Trustee of Saskatchewan outlining the Respondent's position respecting the Estate and querying the Public Trustee (Exhibit R-4). It received no reply to this letter.

[6] The Respondent's witness, Mr. Peake, stated that the assessment was made on the basis of the T-3's because there is no evidence that the total shortage claimed by the Appellant of $14,336.55 is deductible. It might result from general administration fees by the Public Trustee, or what the Public Trustee called the "smoothing" of gains and losses, or something else altogether.

[7] Mr. Peake is correct. The onus is on the Appellant to prove that (the shortfall of $14,336.55 or) the individual amounts claimed in each year are due to deductible expenditures. There is no evidence before the Court respecting the cause of these shortfalls. It is for the Appellant to establish the cause and the fact that the discrepancies are deductible for income tax purposes. The Appellant did not do this.

[8] For this reason, the appeals are dismissed.

Signed at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, this 3rd day of July, 2002.
