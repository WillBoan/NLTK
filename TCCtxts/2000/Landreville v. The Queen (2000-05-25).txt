REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

P.R. Dussault, J.T.C.C.

[1] So that was essentially the meaning of my question. It is that when a taxpayer contributes to a spousal RRSP, if subsequently there are amounts to be included in the spouse's income, in this case that of Ms. Landreville, there is an exception that provides that contributions to the RRSP in the year of withdrawal and in the two previous years are reallocated to the person who made the contributions.

[2] Obviously, that would have been the only way to reduce the $78,000 included in Ms. Landreville's income for 1994, that is, to reduce the amount of the contributions for 1994, if applicable, and for 1993 and 1992. That was all that was meant by my question concerning subsection 146(8.3). I have no evidence on that. The RRSP was in Ms. Landreville's name, granted, and there was a withdrawal in 1994 to pay the husband's debts. That does not change the tax treatment in any way.

[3] The wording of the Act is very clear. Under subsection 146(8), it is included in Ms. Landreville's income for 1994.

[4] Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 25th day of May 2000.
