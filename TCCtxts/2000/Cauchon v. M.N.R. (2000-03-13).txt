Lesage, D.J.T.C.C.

(c) The payer's shareholders were Justin Cauchon (33.3%), Denis Noël (33.3%) and Florent Genest (33.3%).

(d) During the periods at issue, Justin Cauchon was the appellant's spouse.

(l) The appellant provided a sufficient number of weeks of service to the payer to qualify for unemployment or employment insurance benefits.

(m) When the Appellant was receiving unemployment or employment insurance benefits, she drew the maximum amount to which she was entitled and she was immediately entered on the payer's or La Belle Couture Inc.'s payroll as soon as the benefits ceased.

(n) The 1997-1998 period does not coincide with the payer's busiest period.

[6] These descriptions of the appellant's employment are substantially consistent with the testimony given and the written evidence filed at the hearing.

[7] The provisions of both subparagraph 3(2)(c)(ii) of the Unemployment Insurance Act and paragraph 5(3)(b) of the Employment Insurance Act apply to the present appeals:

Section 3(2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act reads in part as follows:

(2) Excepted employment is

. . .

(c) subject to paragraph (d), employment where the employer and employee are not dealing with each other at arm's length and, for the purposes of this paragraph,

(i) the question of whether persons are not dealing with each other at arm's length shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, and

(ii) where the employer is, within the meaning of that Act, related to the employee, they shall be deemed to deal with each other at arm's length if the Minister of National Revenue is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the employment, including the remuneration paid, the terms and conditions, the duration and the nature and importance of the work performed, it is reasonable to conclude that they would have entered into a substantially similar contract of employment if they had been dealing with each other at arm's length;

. . .

[8] The Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") is satisfied that the appellant's non-arm's-length relationship with her employers, of which the husband is a shareholder and chief officer, played a role such that the employment held by the appellant would not have been offered, and in actual fact was not offered, to another person under the same conditions.

[9] The Minister noted, among other things, the salary, which was higher than that given all the other workers performing the same duties.

[10] The fact that the appellant could work at home for La Belle Couture Inc. without any control being exercised over the hours worked and under circumstances where the results alone were quantifiable, and the fact that she worked for La Pomme de Terre St-Ubalde Inc. for better pay than the other workers and without being subject to any control over her hours worked, are factors the Minister had to take into account.

[11] Moreover, the appellant had a period of paid vacation. She is the only one to have enjoyed such a benefit and in addition to that there was the payment of her airline ticket to Florida.

[12] The appeals officer noted the existence of more favourable employment conditions for the appellant as compared with the other employees performing the same duties, which conditions can only be explained by the non-arm's-length relationship.

[13] The Minister's investigation revealed that the appellant's hiring was more to serve her personal needs with respect to qualifying for unemployment and/or employment insurance benefits, depending on the dates, than to meet the needs of the businesses managed by her husband.

[14] On the strength of the conclusions based on the facts in the two appeals, the Minister determined that the appellant's employment with La Belle Couture Inc. and La Pomme de Terre St-Ubalde Inc. was not insurable.

[15] It is not for the Court to interfere with a decision that is the Minister's to make and which he has made in the judicious exercise of his duties and powers under the Act.

[16] The appeals are dismissed.
