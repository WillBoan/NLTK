[3] As Mr. Dagnon stated that the only item on the Bill of Costs that he was disputing was the $700.00 counsel fee claimed for this taxation of costs, I will allow the amount of $2,675.00 for services of counsel.

[4] Mr. Dagnon stated that counsel for the Respondent had made requests for payment of the costs, but that he did not have the funds to pay them. He further stated that it was not necessary to proceed to tax the Bill of Costs.

[5] Ms. Kingston stated that the $700.00 counsel fee claimed for the taxation of costs is the amount set out in Schedule II, Tariff B of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure). She further stated that when a party is required to proceed to taxation, they are entitled to recover this amount.

DECISION

[6] For use at this hearing, the Respondent filed an Affidavit of Carla Riley-Green, affirmed August 18, 2009. Attached as Exhibit “C” to the Affidavit of Carla Riley-Green is a letter from counsel for the Respondent to the Appellant dated June 3, 2009 enclosing the Bill of Costs. The letter of June 3, 2009 requested that the Appellant sign the Bill of Costs, if he concurred with the amounts claimed. The letter further requested that a cheque in the amount of $3,547.53 be remitted to counsel. The last paragraph of the June 3, 2009 letter stated that the Respondent would be seeking an additional $700.00, if a formal taxation of costs was required.

[7] Exhibit “D” to the Affidavit of Carla Riley-Green is another letter from counsel for the Respondent to the Appellant dated July 6, 2009, which renewed the request for payment of costs in the amount of $3,547.53, failing which the Respondent would proceed to have the matter scheduled for a taxation of costs.

[8] Mr. Dagnon did not respond to the correspondence from counsel for the Respondent. It was clearly set out in the letter of June 3, 2009 (Exhibit “C” to the Affidavit of Carla Riley-Green) that the Respondent would be seeking an additional $700.00 if the matter proceeded to taxation. As a result of the Appellant’s failure to respond to the correspondence, the Respondent had no choice but to request an appointment to tax the Bill of Costs. I will accordingly allow the amount of $700.00 claimed for the taxation of costs.

[9] The amounts claimed for disbursements were well documented. Receipts for the disbursements claimed were attached as Exhibits to the Affidavit of Carla Riley-Green. I will accordingly allow the amount of $872.53 for disbursements.

[10] The Respondent’s Bill of Costs is taxed and $4,247.53 is allowed. A certificate in that amount will be issued.

Signed at Toronto, Ontario, this 17th day of November 2009.
