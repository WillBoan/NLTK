REASONS FOR TAXATION

Alan Ritchie, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This matter came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on Thursday, March 27, 2008. It follows a Judgment of the Honourable Justice Lamarre of this Court issued on July 20, 2007, allowing the appeal, with one set of costs to the seven Appellants whose appeals were heard on common evidence.

[2] The Appellants were represented by Me Claude Nadeau, and the Respondent by Me Benoît Denis.

[3] It was agreed that the only question to be decided was the proper Class of Proceedings to be used in applying Tariff B in the preparation of the Appellants Bill of Costs. Each of the seven appeals were properly filed and heard as Class A appeals. Counsel for the Appellant took the position that the amounts at issue in the seven files should be considered cumulatively, and he prepared his Bill of Costs under Class B as a result.

[4] The Bill of Costs as submitted under class B is in the amount of $13,526.42; if prepared under class A it would have totalled $11,201.42.

APPELLANT

[5] Counsel for the Appellant conceded that only one set of costs was awarded by the Honourable Justice Lamarre in her judgment. However, he took the position that she had not indicated the class, and further that her intent was likely that the amounts at issue for the seven files should be aggregated – resulting in costs under class B.

[6] He referred to Schedule II, Tariff A of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (hereinafter, the Rules) where the aggregates of all amounts at issue are used to determine the class of an individual appeal – and drew an analogy with the question at issue – to justify claiming costs under class B.

[7] Counsel also referred to section 154 of the Rules which sets out the factors to be considered by the Taxing Officer when taxing costs. He noted that the appeals dealt with important issues, that were the first of their kind and therefore were test cases, which were of a considerably complex nature, and that the workload involved in preparing for the hearing was significant.

[8] There were over 800 products used by the hospitals for in vitro diagnostic procedures, each of which had to be reviewed in order to determine whether or not they were essential for the diagnosis. This information was presented by an expert witness at trial. Counsel at the taxation pointed to the fact that Justice Lamarre had referred to the analysis done by the expert witness – and the four general categories of products that were presented – extensively in her reasons for judgment.

[9] He also noted that the amounts actually at issue in the seven appeals represented only 17% of the total GST originally paid, as 83% had already been reimbursed to the Appellants – and that this was a significant amount.

[10] There was no jurisprudence put forward in support of the Appellants’ position.

RESPONDENT

[11] Counsel for the Respondent took a different view than his counterpart with respect to the amount of work involved in preparing for trial, and the notion that these were test cases. Rather than being considered test cases, it was his view that since the introduction of the GST this was simply the first time this question had been considered by the Court, and that there was nothing exceptional involved. With respect to the work done by the expert, he noted that the information was summarized into four broad categories of products when it was presented at trial, and that the total number of products reviewed was immaterial.

[12] He also dismissed the notion that the amount of tax in question was somehow more than the 17% at issue in the seven files – that the other 83% had been reimbursed and was not relevant in any way to what the Taxing Officer should consider under section 154 of the Rules.

[13] Counsel for the Respondent said it was clear that the Court had awarded one set of costs, and that the matter of costs had been explicitly addressed at trial. In the absence of any further direction from the Court, the costs should be under the same class as the seven files – class A. He noted that the Appellants could have sought direction from the Court regarding costs following the issuance of the judgment as provided for in subsection 147(7) of the Rules – but that they had not.

[14] Counsel for the Respondent cited the following cases in support of his position:

Adam & Associés v. the Queen 2005 TCC 321 – without direction from the Court, a taxing officer has no reason to change the class of the appeal;

Bergen v. The Queen 94-1510(IT)G – unless otherwise ordered by the Court, the class of the appeal is determined at the outset and does not change because several appeals heard on common evidence have an aggregate amount at issue that would fall under a different class;

Tsang v. the Queen 93-155(IT)G – the amount at issue in a given appeal determines its class; and

Crompton v. The Queen 97 DTC 1507 – only the Court can award costs beyond the Tariff, not the Taxing Officer.

[15] Counsel for the Respondent summarized his position by saying it was very clear in his mind that the Court had awarded one set of costs, and that those costs were under class A as all seven appeals were filed under that class.

DECISION

[16] There are two general principles upon which I base my view of the matter at hand.

[17] The first is that, in absence of direction from the Court otherwise, when appeals are heard on common evidence the Appellant(s) are entitled to one set of costs. In essence, it is as if only one appeal had been heard for the purposes of determining costs. In this case, Justice Lamarre explicitly stated in her decision that this was the case.

[18] The second is that the class of an appeal is properly determined at the point of filing the Notice of Appeal, and does not change.

[19] Taken together, my view is that for the purposes of determining costs, this is similar to a single class A appeal for which costs have been awarded to the Appellant.

[20] Counsel for the Respondent referred to case law (above) in support of his position, and the situation in Bergen is the same as in this matter: two class B appeals were heard on common evidence, the Court awarded one set of costs to the Appellants, and the Appellants aggregated the amounts at issue in the two appeals and submitted a Bill of Costs under class C.

[21] The Taxing Officer ruled at the taxation in favour of the Respondent.

[22] Although there may be instances where the volume of work related to preparing many appeals for trial on common evidence could justify costs above the amounts set out in the Tariff, as Taxing Officer I have no authority to make that determination as noted in Crompton.

[23] Parties faced with such a situation should raise the matter at trial in hopes of obtaining clarity from the Court in the judgment, or apply for special direction on costs under subsection 147(7) following the issuance of the judgment.

[24] The Bill of Costs is taxed, and I allow the sum of $11,201.42.
