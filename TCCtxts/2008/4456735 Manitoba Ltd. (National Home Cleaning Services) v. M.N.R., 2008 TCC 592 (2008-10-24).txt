AMENDED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Beaubier, D.J.

[1] These appeals were heard together on common evidence at Winnipeg, Manitoba on October 24, 2008. Daniel Gagnon testified for the Appellant. Lisa Wilson testified on her own behalf. The Minister of National Revenue called Annette Bonneteau, one of the cleaners allegedly employed by the Appellant. Patricia Jensen did not appear.

[2] The particulars in dispute are set out in paragraphs 2 – 10 inclusive in the Reply to the Notice of Appeal #2008-458(EI). They read:

2. By letters dated July 20, 2007, the Winnipeg Tax Services Offices issued rulings that Annette Bonneteau (hereinafter “Bonneteau”), Patricia Jensen (hereinafter “Jensen”) and Lisa Wilson (hereinafter “Wilson”) were in insurable employment with the Appellant.

3. By a letter received September 10, 2007, the Appellant appealed to the Minister for a reconsideration of the rulings.

4. In response to the appeal, the Minister decided that:

(a) Bonneteau was employed under a contract of service with the Appellant for the period January 1, 2006 to August 25, 2006.

(b) Jensen was employed under a contract of service with the Appellant for the period January 1, 2006 to July 20, 2007, and

(c) Wilson was employed under a contract of service with the Appellant for the period January 1, 2006 to February 28, 2007.

B. ISSUE TO BE DECIDED

6. The issue to be decided is whether the Workers were employed under a contract of service with the Appellant during the periods under review.

C. STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT

7. The Respondent relied on, among other things, paragraph 5(1)(a) and subsection 2(1) of the Employment Insurance Act.

8. The Respondent submits that Bonneteau was engaged in insurable employment within the meaning of paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Employment Insurance Act as she was engaged under contract of service with the Appellant for the period January 1, 2006 to August 25, 2006.

9. The Respondent submits that Jensen was engaged in insurable employment within the meanings of paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Employment Insurance Act as she was engaged under a contract of service with the Appellant for the period January 1, 2006 to July 20, 2007.

10. The Respondent submits that Wilson was engaged in insurable employment within the meaning of paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Employment Insurance Act as she was engaged under a contract of service with the appellant for the period January 1, 2006 to February 28, 2007.

[3] All of the assumptions in paragraph 5 of the Reply were either confirmed by the evidence or were not refuted excepting or subject to the following as referred to by the subparagraph:

(j) At first it was 60% and then they negotiated a raise to 64%.

(k) The 60% was prefixed by the manager. The 64% was negotiated.

(p) See (j) and (k).

(q) This was done at the end of each day when the workers got resupplied and their assignments for the next day.

(ff) Some worked in pairs and some worked alone.

(ll) And the workers could quit.

(mm) The workers could and once did refuse work after an argument.

(yy) The vehicle drivers used their own vehicles and bought their own gas.

(fff) See (yy) comment re vehicles.

(iii) Is the subject of the dispute.

[4] Using the criteria established in Weibe Door Services Ltd. v. MNR [1986] 3 F.C. 553 for reviewing contracts respecting a question of employment, the Court finds:

(1) Control – The Appellant got the contracts and fixed the prices, the number of homes a worker would clean each day, the length of time the work would take and the workers reported to National at the end of each day for their supplies and assignments for the next day. The workers delivered any fees they had collected to National then.

(2) Tools – All tools and supplies were National’s, except the vehicle and gas of the workers.

(3) Risk of Profit or Loss - The workers were paid their percentage amounts whether National was paid or not. The workers did not hire helpers or replacements.

(4) Integration – It might seem that the workers were separate from National. But National did not let Mrs. Wilson take time off for her honeymoon. She testified that she only had one day off in the course of a year. This degree of control, the daily reports and assignments, the weekly pay by National of their daily percentages and the fact that National satisfied and obtained the contracts and assigned the work to be done and the times, durations and locations of the work indicate that the workers were integrated into National’s work.

[5] The workers were not performing the services as persons in business on their own accounts.

[6] The appeals are dismissed.

These reasons are issued in substitution for the reasons dated
