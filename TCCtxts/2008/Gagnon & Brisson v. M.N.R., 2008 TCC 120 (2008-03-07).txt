REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Tardif J.

[1] The two Appellants in these appeals worked for Karine Brisson, who operated a restaurant under the business name Rétro Dog II.

[2] In both matters, the Respondent determined that the Appellants' employment was excluded from insurable employment under subsection 5(2) of the Employment Insurance Act because the parties were not dealing with each other at arm's length.

[3] Since the facts related to the appeals were essentially the same, the parties agreed to proceed on common evidence.

[4] The periods in issue in the matter of Claudette Gagnon, 2007-2416(EI), are from April 25 to October 15, 2005, and from April 28 to September 22, 2006. In the matter of Rodrigue Brisson, 2007-2879(EI), the periods in issue are from May 2 to October 15, 2005, and from April 18 to October 14, 2006.

[5] In the matter of Claudette Gagnon, 2007-2416(EI), the Respondent relied on the following assumptions of fact to make his decision:

[7] Subparagraphs 5(a) through (d) and subparagraphs 6(a) through (k) are essentially the same and were admitted to by the Appellants; as for the other subparagraphs, the Appellant Claudette Gagnon admitted to subparagraphs 6(l) through (p) as well as 6(t), (u), (w) and (y), and denied subparagraphs 6(q), (r), (s), (v), (x), (z) and (aa); the Appellant Rodrigue Brisson, for his part, admitted to subparagraphs 6(l), (o), (s), (z), (bb) and (cc) and denied subparagraphs 6(m), (n), (p), (q), (r), (v), (w), (x), (y) and (aa).

[8] Both Appellants testified. Rodrigue Brisson provided the most specific testimony. Among other things, he explained and described the chain of events and his various experiences before working for his daughter by running a restaurant that he had previously run with his spouse.

[9] Mr. Brisson mainly attacked specific allegations, claiming, among other things, that he did not open the restaurant at roughly 4:30 to 5:00 a.m. because he was the one who closed it at midnight.

[10] Mr. Brisson denied receiving all the correspondence concerning the restaurant. He sought to demolish this allegation by tendering a document certifying that the owner, his daughter, had received a document concerning the operation of the restaurant at her private residence.

[11] He also denied that his residence, and especially the office set up there, was used to store all documents associated with the operation of the business, but he did admit that the day-to-day bookkeeping and the previous year's accounting records were indeed kept there.

[12] In addition, he denied that he went to the place of business early in the morning because the dishes made at the house were not yet ready at that time.

[13] However, he admitted that he worked without pay, though he hastened to add that the work in question was minor and comparable to what that a father would be prepared to do to help his children with a painting job. He said that, in this case, the work did not involve painting, but rather work such as preparing and delivering food and producing various GST and QST returns.

[14] In order to justify his unpaid work, Rodrigue Brisson said that he thought he had the right to work a few hours without losing the right to receive employment insurance benefits.

[15] He also said that not reporting the hours that he worked might have been a mistake.

[16] With respect to the use of the personal kitchen and the garage set up specifically to prepare meals served at the restaurant, Rodrige Brisson explained that, first of all, this use generated truly minimal electricity costs, and that, secondly, his wife received $60 to $80 in compensation over and above her remuneration each week. According to the Appellants, this amount was partly to compensate for the use of the premises and cover some of the electricity expenses incurred, but it also served to pay for the cleaning work that was done after the premises were used.

[17] The Appellants' personal kitchen, and the garage where the equipment was located, were used intensively for the preparation of numerous meals during the period when the restaurant was operating, and afterwards, during the period when meals had to be prepared and delivered as part of the second component of the business, namely the catering service.

[18] These were major, intensive and daily activities, because the restaurant in which the meals were served was too small to prepare meals in large quantities.

[19] Indeed, only a few very quick dishes were prepared at the restaurant, and even then, the basic ingredients had most often already been prepared at the Appellants' personal residence.

[20] The Appellant was also responsible for running errands, transporting the meals from the private residence to the restaurant, transporting the restaurant's garbage cans, closing the restaurant, and looking after basic bookkeeping. The other bookkeeping was done by another person whose services the business retained.

[21] As for the Appellant Claudette Gagnon, she explained that she started her work very early in the morning, at roughly 4 a.m, by preparing the homemade bread, the desserts and the lunch dishes. Her work ended at approximately 1 p.m.

[22] She explained that, in addition to her weekly pay, she received compensation ranging from $60 to $80 per week for cleaning, for the use of the kitchen and garage, and to reimburse electricity costs and the costs of various housekeeping products.

[23] As for the amount of time that it took to do the cleaning, Ms. Gagnon said that it could vary, but that it generally took a few hours, though it could sometimes take more than four hours, for example when a mishap, like a spill, or an overflow of pie filling during baking, took place.

[24] However, she added that when something like this happened, the burden was not borne by her daughter Karine; in other words, if she had to spend a large number of hours cleaning her kitchen and garage, her daughter had nothing to do with this extra work. The least that can be said is that this is not the way that an ordinary employee would act.

[25] Louise Dessureault, the appeals officer, also testified. She explained what led to her determination that it was not reasonable to believe that the Appellants would have entered into a substantially similar employment contract, having regard to the terms and conditions and duration of the work, if they had been dealing with each other at arm's length.

[26] In fact, she grouped together the elements taken into account based on the various factors listed by Parliament, namely the terms and conditions of employment, the remuneration paid, the nature and importance of the work, and the duration of the employment.

[27] The appeals officer's analysis of the file shed light on a nebulous aspect of the financing, namely the fact that, in a sense, the Appellant Rodrigue Brisson financed the restaurant that his daughter purchased after a fire that took place at the time that he was running it. This fact was acknowledged by Mr. Brisson, who said that he preferred to receive the interest rather than see his daughter pay it to a bank.

[28] Ms. Dessureault also prepared a table showing the time that the Appellants spent on their catering service:

$134,698.29

In light of this table, Ms. Dessureault concluded that the Appellants did a substantial amount of unpaid work as part of their catering service; moreover, they got nothing for the occupancy of the premises, and they even bore the costs associated with the use of the premises: telephone, rent, electricity, etc.

[29] She also noted that the compensation artificially increased the insurable earnings, though a significant amount of this money, according to the Appellants' own admission, served to reimburse part of the rent, the electricity bill and other expenses.

[30] In addition, Ms. Dessureault shed light on certain evidence concerning the number of hours of work at the beginning and end of the periods, showing unambiguously that things worked exactly as though the business were being operated jointly by the Appellants and their daughter.

[31] Did the analysis contain factors other than those established by the evidence? Did it take irrelevant considerations into account? Was a great deal of weight accorded to irrelevant considerations? My answer to all these questions is that the investigation obtained most, if not all, of the relevant evidence. Moreover, the analysis is entirely appropriate, and I consider the conclusions to be very reasonable under the circumstances.

[32] Mr. Brisson certainly managed to show that he was not the person who opened the restaurant at 5 a.m. He certainly made some clarifications with respect to the fact that almost all the documents related to the management of the restaurant were in an office inside his personal residence. He also proved that his daughter, the Payor, had on at least one occasion received correspondence concerning the restaurant, thereby demolishing the assumption that all documents concerning the restaurant were addressed to Ms. Gagnon's personal residence.

[33] Those considerations are completely secondary and marginal in the analysis of a matter of this kind.

[34] The true question is whether a third party or third parties would have accepted similar working conditions, a job of similar duration, and similar remuneration to what existed in the case at bar.

[35] In the instant case, the Appellants made their home's kitchen and garage available to the restaurant in exchange for ludicrously low amounts of money.

[36] The Appelants' pay was entirely unrelated to the number of hours that they worked, and this is completely contrary to employment practices in this field.

[37] The Appellants routinely worked free of charge. The real reason for the addition to Ms. Gagnon's remuneration was to cover part of the electricity and rent.

[38] Those are a few decisive elements based on which it can be concluded, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that no one at arm's length would have accepted such an employment relationship.

[39] Although, employment by a person with whom one is not dealing at arm's length is clearly excluded from insurable employment, the exclusion is not absolute.

[40] However, in assessing evidence that goes to the question of whether a person at arm's length might have agreed to substantially similar terms and conditions of employment, it is certainly important to take into account what I would call the dynamism, interest, enthusiasm, zeal, and, to some extent, the volunteer spirit of employees who are not dealing with their employers at arm's length; this can be an acceptable and even reasonable situation, depending on the context.

[41] Not everyone who works in such a context should be penalized. However, terms and conditions of employment that are patently unreasonable because they cross the line of acceptability must be rejected.

[42] In the case at bar, there is no doubt in my mind that the preponderance of the evidence, both during the investigation and analysis and during the hearing, decisively showed that the Appellants' terms and conditions of employment were significantly shaped by their non-arm's-length relationship with the Payor, to the point that I wondered whether the Appellants were still the restaurant's true owners.

[43] For these reasons, the appeals are dismissed.
