[OFFICIAL ENGLISH TRANSLATION]

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Jorré J.

[1] This is a reference from a Review Tribunal under subsection 28(2) of the Old Age Security Act ("the Act").

[2] Both appeals were heard on common evidence.

[3] In 2004, Mr. Badouraly was laid off by his employer, which paid him only two weeks of salary as severance pay. The Appellant was, however, entitled to a greater amount.

[4] Mr. Badouraly had to file a complaint with the Commission des normes du travail du Québec. Subsequently, in 2005, he received an additional gross amount of $5,520 from the employer.

[5] The issue is whether this amount of $5,520 is part of Mr. Badouraly's income for the year 2005 within the meaning of section 2 of the Act.

[6] This issue is significant because the inclusion of the amount reduces both Mr. Badouraly and Ms. Goulamaly's Guaranteed Income Supplement.

[7] I note that the Minister reduced the included amount by $1,500, which is equal to the amount of employment insurance benefits repaid by Mr. Badouraly in 2005.

[8] The Appellants' position is that the amount of $5,520 should not be included in computing the income for 2005 because the employer should have paid it to him in 2004.[1]

[9] Section 2 of the Act provides that income must be computed in accordance with the rules contained in the Income Tax Act (ITA). For income tax purposes, the amount of $5,520 must be included at the time that it was received.[2]

[10] Consequently, I must, regretfully, confirm that the Minister of Human Resources and Social Development correctly included the amount of $5,520 for the 2005 base year. I have a great deal of sympathy for the Appellants, but this outcome results from the employer's failure to fulfil its obligations in 2004, not from an error on the Minister's part.
