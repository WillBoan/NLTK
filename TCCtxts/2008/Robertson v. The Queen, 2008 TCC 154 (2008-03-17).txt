[3] The children are both boys.

[4] The Court accepts the Appellant’s evidence respecting her living arrangements at the times in question, which is as follows:

(1) From 2001 to May 31, 2002, the Appellant lived common-law with Cody Bear on Pendygrasse Road. They broke up on May 31, 2002.

(2) June 1, 2002, the Appellant was living alone on Pendygrasse Road and moved next door and lived with her cousin, Lindsay Burns, at 3243 – 373 Pendygrasse Road in December, 2002 for three or four months.

(3) From about March to September, 2003, the Appellant, still living singly, moved from there to her mother’s residence at 1109 – 121 Clancy Drive.

(4) The Appellant became pregnant with Coden and reconciled with Cody Bear in September, 2003 and in October, 2003, they moved to 326 – 3170 Laurier Drive, whereupon Cody moved out in November, 2003. (The Court does not regard this as the resumption of the common-law relationship which terminated on May 31, 2002 because it accepts the Divorce Act’s reconciliation 90 day rule, which allows a 90 day period for attempted reconciliations.)

(5) After Cody moved out, the Appellant remained alone at 326 – 3170 Laurier Drive and Coden was born.

(6) In December, 2004, Cody and the Appellant attempted to reconcile at Laurier Drive for three weeks and she became pregnant with Breydan. Cody left at the end of three weeks. The Appellant was working at Freeway Gas at this time.

(7) Mid-August, 2005, the Appellant moved from Laurier Drive to 253 Meighen Crescent. In September, Breydan was born; she returned to work in January, 2006. In August, 2006, the Appellant was accepted into an upgrade program and she is now in training to become a nurse.

[5] The Appellant has been living as a single person since May 31, 2002. She does not know Cody’s address and he apparently has no permanent residence. The Appellant informed the Court that the police have contacted her about Cody because he has falsely described her address as Cody’s from time to time; she is believed about this.

[6] Based on these facts, the Court finds that the Appellant has not lived common-law with Cody Bear, but has lived singly since May 31, 2002, with the children after they were born.

[7] Thus, the Court finds that since the base date of May 31, 2002, and for the appropriate quarters after that date, (a) Cody’s income should not be included in the calculation of an adjusted income within the meaning of section 122.6 of the Income Tax Act for the months of July, 2004 to April, 2006 of the 2003 and 2004 base taxation years; and (b) after the base date of May 31, 2002, Cody was not the Appellant’s common-law partner or qualified relation within the meaning of section 122.5 of the Income Tax Act for the appropriate quarters from July, 2002 to October, 2005, respecting the appropriate base taxation years.

[8] The appeal is allowed and the CCTB, the GSTC and the SCB are to be adjusted by the Minister in accordance with these findings.
