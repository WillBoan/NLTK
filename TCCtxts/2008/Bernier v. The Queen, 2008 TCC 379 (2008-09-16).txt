REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

(Delivered orally from the bench on June 17, 2008, at Montréal, Quebec, and amended for greater clarity and precision)

Hogan J.

[1] Réal Bernier is appealing an income tax assessment for his 2006 taxation year. Under section 18.1 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, the informal procedure applies to his appeal.

[2] At the conclusion of the trial, I dismissed the taxpayer's appeal. For the parties' benefit, I consider it appropriate to put my reasons down in writing now.

[3] The issue arises out of the fact that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) charged the Appellant a total of $120.21 in instalment interest.

[4] The facts set out in paragraphs 3 to 6 of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal are as follows:

[TRANSLATION]

3. The Minister initially assessed the Appellant for the 2006 taxation year on May 22, 2007.

4. On or about June 5, 2007, the Appellant served on the Minister his objection to the assessment dated May 22, 2007, for the 2006 taxation year.

5. In reply to the Appellant's objection to the assessment dated May 22, 2007, for the 2006 taxation year, the Minister confirmed the assessment on July 18, 2007.

6. In making and confirming the assessment of May 22, 2007, for the 2006 taxation year, the Minister relied on the following assumptions of fact:

*Registered retirement savings plan

(d) On May 22, 2007, the Appellant's tax account for his 2006 taxation year broke down as follows:

Description

( $751.24)

(e) On May 11, 2006, the Appellant's tax account for his 2005 taxation year broke down as follows:

Description

Amount

Federal tax

$4,478.35

Refundable abatement

( $738.93)

(f) On June 9, 2005, the Appellant's tax account for his 2004 taxation year broke down as follows:

Description

Amount

Federal tax

$4,206.56

Refundable abatement

( $694.08)

Tax deductions

($1,945.34)

(g) The Appellant was required to make tax instalment payments for the 2004 and 2005 taxation years;

(h) During the 2006 taxation year, the Appellant was required to pay the following amounts quarterly, that is, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15:

Period

Amount

March 15

$392.00

June 15

$392.00

(i) The Appellant did not make his instalment payments for his 2006 taxation year;

(j) Instalment reminders were sent to the Appellant on the required dates to inform him of the payments he had to make for the 2006 taxation year;

(k) Since the Appellant did not make any tax instalment payments for the 2006 taxation year, the Minister claimed $120.21 in instalment interest;

(l) As well, since the Appellant did not pay his tax balance until May 24, 2007, even though he was required to pay it on April 30, 2007, the Minister claimed $10.70 in arrears interest.

Issues

[5] The issues are whether, for the 2006 taxation year:

(a) the Appellant was required to make tax instalment payments;

(b) the Minister was right to charge the Appellant $120.21 in instalment interest;

(c) the Minister was right to charge the Appellant $10.70 in arrears interest;

(d) the Minister correctly calculated the instalment and arrears interest.

[6] With regard to the interest, subsection 161(1) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) is clear and unambiguous. The Court has no jurisdiction to cancel or reduce interest properly charged under subsection 161(2) of the ITA.

[7] The Appellant did not provide any valid reason to challenge the charging of interest by the CRA. As his only argument, he referred to sections 146 and 147 of the ITA without establishing their relevance. For these reasons, the Court dismisses the appeal.
