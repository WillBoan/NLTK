Docket: 1999-3016(GST)I

BETWEEN:

JOYCE LIND,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

(delivered orally from the bench

at Victoria, British Columbia, on

October 20, 1999)

O'Connor, J.T.C.C.

[1] The Appellant has presented an excellent case and if she was the only witness here, she'd probably win her appeal. But I accept entirely the credibility of what has to be considered an independent witness, Mr. McKenzie, the alleged former resident. He has essentially convinced me that he was in no way establishing a place of residence in Unit 303.

[2] That's the criteria and I could go on, but regrettably, the appeal must be dismissed,

Signed at Ottawa, Canada this 21st day of December 1999.
