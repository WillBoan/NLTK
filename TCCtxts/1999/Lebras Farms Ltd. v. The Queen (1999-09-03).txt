[4] Assumptions 9(b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) are correct. Assumptions (h) and (i) were not refuted and, except for the exact dates, they were confirmed by the evidence. Assumption (j) is an overstatement: on the evidence the "change" was merely to affix decals indicating that the combine was a 97 model. Contrary to assumption (k), on the evidence there was no further "manufacture" to the combine after its original production was completed prior to November 11, 1993. Assumption (l) is correct. Assumption (m) was not rebutted. Assumption (n) is correct and was explained by Mr. Cook who stated that Farm World tries to give its customers a full season warranty including pre-season coverage in the second season, which always causes quarrels with the manufacturers. The Court accepts this as true and as constituting a true description of responsible dealer practices where possible. Mr. Cook's testimony that the Swathmaster was ordered on December 29, 1993 is accepted; the evidence that it was manufactured by Precision Metal Manufacturing of Rosetown, Saskatchewan before December 25 1993 is accepted as true. Assumptions (p) and (q) are correct. Assumption (r) was not refuted.

[5] Assumption (r) respecting the Header is correct (Exhibit R-1, Tab 5).

[6] Assumption (s) was not refuted, but the Court accepts Mr. Lebras' testimony that the trade-ins were available for Farm World to pick up and sell "whenever". In confirmation of this, the evidence is that the Appellant paid the cash portion of the sale on December 22, 1993 and made sure that it had the serial number for the TR97 it purchased at the time it signed the Form A Contract under the Saskatchewan Agricultural Implement Act on December 22, 1993. Farm World received the trade-ins well before delivering the new TR97 554584 Ford-New Holland combine to the Appellant. The Appellant also deleted the trade-ins from its insurance coverage and added TR97, Serial #554584 to its insurance on December 22, 1993. There was no delivery date specified in the Form A Contract, but both parties understood that the new combine had to be delivered to the Appellant by August 15, 1994 when it would commence its combine season. This occurred and until then the Appellant had no use for it.

[7] Thus, assumption (t) is incorrect; after December 22, 1993 nothing was owed by the Appellant on the contract.

[8] In these circumstances, the first question to be dealt with is whether the Appellant acquired Combine TR97- Serial #554584 before January 1, 1994. This contract in Form A was an unconditional contract for the sale of the combine in a deliverable state. On the evidence, the only change to the combine after Form A was signed was affixing decals indicating "97". Thus, property in the combine passed at the date that the parties signed Form A. The combine is severable from the header and the Swathmaster. The header's serial # is also in Form A and, on the evidence it was completely manufactured before January 1, 1994; as a result Form A constitutes an unconditional contract for the sale of the header in a deliverable state. Property in the header passed at the date that the parties signed Form A.

[9] The Swathmaster is an attachment to the combine and the header. It was manufactured by a different manufacturer than the combine and header. It is also a form of attachment that is commonly known in the farming industry to be affixed to a combine for specific and different uses as distinct from, for example, a reel or a corn harvesting attachment. It is also sold for separate and known prices. For these reasons, the Court finds the contract for sale of the Swathmaster to be severable from the remainder of the Form A Contract before the Court in the amount of the listed retail price of a Swathmaster on December 22, 1993.

[10] The Swathmaster which the Appellant acquired was not identified to the Form A Contract between the Appellant and Farm World before 1994, with the result that it was not acquired by the Appellant within the meaning of subsection 127(9) and the Sale of Goods Act of Saskatchewan. (Anderson Ventures Inc. v. Jarvie Farm Equipment (1976) Ltd. (1987) Sask. R. 34.)

[11] The combine and the header were not "... used, or acquired for use or lease, for any purpose whatever before it was acquired by the taxpayer ..." in the words of subsection 127(9). There are two reasons for this:

1. The combine and header were acquired by the Appellant on December 22, 1993 before anyone used them for anything, and

2. David Cook testified that "dealer training" at Las Vegas consisted of a combine rising from below floor level under spot lights with dancing showgirls surrounding it. Neither this nor a more formal "dealer training" makes the combine used in the sense of subsection 127(9). Putting the combine and possibly the header, on display at dealership shows conducted by the manufacturer does not constitute use or make them used. Their sole use is to combine grain in farm fields where the profits of farming are earned. If they are shown in showrooms ("displayed"), or shown for dealer training, they are not used or even in use for the purposes of farming operations which is their market. Indeed, if showroom display constituted "used" in the sense of subsection 127(9), any new vehicle, goods or property put on display or shown for training by a manufacturer or retailer before sale would be "used". That cannot be the meaning contained in subsection 127(9). (See London and Eastern Counties Loan Co. v. Creasy [1897] 1 Q.B. 768)

[12] Because Form A was a complete contract on December 22, 1993 when it was executed,

(a) The Appellant is entitled to claim an Investment Tax Credit in its 1994 taxation year in respect to the value of New Holland combine, Model TR97 – Serial #554584 and header model 971 – Serial #571809, (but not for the Swathmaster) in its 1994 taxation year.

(i) The combine and header were acquired after December 2, 1992 and before 1994. The Swathmaster having been manufactured by a different manufacturer, shipped separately to Farm World for attachment to the New Holland combine and header and not having been identified to the Appellant's Contract until delivery, was acquired upon delivery on August 9, 1994.

(ii) The combine, header and Swathmaster had not been used or acquired for use for another purpose prior to being acquired by the Appellant.

(b) The Appellant is entitled to claim a deduction for capital cost allowance for the combine and the header in its 1994 taxation year.

(c) The Appellant disposed of its trade-ins in its 1994 taxation year.

(d) The Court has no discretion respecting the assessment of interest and it follows the result of the assessments as determined by this Court.

[13] This matter is referred to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment in accordance with these reasons.

[14] The Appellant is awarded its party and party costs.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 3rd day of September 1999.
