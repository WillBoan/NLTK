Beaubier, J.T.C.C.

*Even though the Appellant calculated a farm loss in the amount of $42,293.40 on his statement of farm income and expenses for the 1994 taxation year, he only claimed the amount of $27,208.42, which was the amount of the loss necessary to reduce his income for the year to nil. He then carried forward the excess portion of the farm loss that he did not require to subsequent years.

8. In reassessing the Appellant for the 1995 taxation year, the Minister assessed net farm income in the amount of $5,764.00 and allowed a restricted farm loss carry forward in the amount of $5,764.00. The net farm income assessed for the year was determined as follows:

*In calculating his farm loss for the year, the Appellant included in his farm loss calculation his carry forward of accumulated farm losses from prior years. He then utilized these farm losses to the extent necessary to reduce his income for the year to nil and he then carried forward the excess portion of the losses that he did not require to subsequent years.

[3] With respect to the issues to be decided, the Court finds:

(a) The Appellant did not dispute the correctness of the Mandatory Inventory Adjustment calculation. Nor did he establish that any of the assumptions in paragraph 9 of the Reply were incorrect. In particular, he did not refute the calculation or the basis for the calculation in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Reply.

(b) Finally, paragraph 111(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act ("Act") prevents the Appellant from carrying forward restricted farm losses against non-farm income.

[4] For these reasons, the appeals are dismissed.
