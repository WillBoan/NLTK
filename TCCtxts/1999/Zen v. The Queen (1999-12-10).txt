REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Beaubier, J.T.C.C.

[1] These appeals pursuant to the General Procedure were heard on December 9, 1999 at Vancouver, British Columbia.

[2] At the opening of hearing the Appellants' counsel withdrew the appeal of Roger Zen by consent without costs. Therefore, it is dismissed. He also withdrew the appeal of Moreno Zen ("Moreno") for the 1994 year. It is also dismissed.

[3] The appeal for 1995 proceeded. Moreno Zen and Colin Moran testified on behalf of Moreno. The Respondent read in portions of the examination for discovery of Moreno. The Appellant did not file any income tax return for 1995. In 1994 he reported taxable income of $83,747. The Minister of National Revenue then assessed him as having a taxable income of $83,747 in 1995. He appealed.

[4] The Appellant reported business income of $83,747.80 in 1994 as the result of a sale of assets of the partnership Zen Properties in which he had a 25% interest. On the evidence presented, his income in the years before and after 1994 was considerably lower than that.

[5] He testified that he had no income from Zen Properties or anyone else in 1995. His testimony was corroborated by Colin Moran, the financial consultant of the Zen Group. The Appellant also filed a statement of his 1995 stock market trades indicating losses.

[6] The Appellant and Mr. Moran testified that although Moreno Zen was born in 1960, he lived in his parents' home in 1995 through to the date of trial. During 1995 his spending money came from over $30,000 loaned to him by his father Giovanni. They are believed.

[7] A short summary of their testimony and Moreno Zen's appearance in Court is that he is a slothful person who lived off of his parents in 1995. As a result, he earned no income, he needed no income and he doesn't have to pay any income tax.

[8] The appeal is allowed.

[9] In respect to the appeal itself, the Appellant did not file any 1995 income tax return until December, 1999. No 1995 full financial statement of Zen Properties was tendered until trial. This despite an adjournment of trial in September and an admonition in the Order of adjournment dated September 20, 1999, that exhibits be tabled and indexed for the hearing. The Court does not consider this to be the fault of the Appellant's Counsel. Rather, it demonstrates the Appellant's attitude toward the entire process. For this reason, the Respondent is awarded party and party costs which the Court fixes in the amount of $3,500.

Signed at Vancouver, Canada this 10th day of December, 1999.
