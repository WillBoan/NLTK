Reasons for Judgment

Beaubier, J.T.C.C.

[1] This appeal pursuant to the General Procedure was heard at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on August 12, 1999. The Appellant called Michael Unick, C.A., Manager, Disbursements and Taxation for the Appellant; Gregory Kuse, LLB; and Barbara Carriere. The Respondent called Larry Gruber, auditor on the file.

[2] The Notice of Appeal described the issues as follows:

2.1 SaskTel submits that the issues to be determined include, inter alia, the following:

(a) Whether any portion of the parking provided to the employees of SaskTel in the relevant periods is a "benefit amount" which is required under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act to be included in computing such employee's income for a taxation year. In determining whether the parking provided to the employees is a "benefit amount", various sub-issues arise, including the following:

(i) whether the parking provided to the SaskTel employees is a supply of a property or service;

(ii) whether an amount in respect of the parking provided to the SaskTel employees is a "benefit", for the purposes of section 6(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act;

(iii) in the event an amount in respect of the parking provided to the SaskTel employees is a "benefit" what the value of such "benefit" is to the employee is for the purposes of section 6(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act;

(b) Whether SaskTel is entitled to the full input tax credit claimed with respect to food, beverages and entertainment or whether 50% of such input tax credits are required to be included in the determination of net tax of SaskTel for the relevant periods.

(c) Whether SaskTel, being an agent of the Provincial Government of the Province of Saskatchewan, can be assessed penalties pursuant to the Excise Tax Act.

(d) Whether any portion of the Minister's assessment is statute barred.

[3] The Assessment Period is September 1, 1992 to December 31, 1995. At the opening of Hearing the Appellant conceded issue (d) and the Respondent conceded issue (c).

[4] Issue (b) must be determined on the basis of Exhibit A-R1, 25, an agreement between the Ministers of Finance of Canada and Saskatchewan which defines GST to be the tax imposed under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act ("Act"), and its regulations as amended. The question then is whether subsection 236(1) of Part IX imposes a tax. It reads:

(1) Where a registrant is the recipient of, or pays an allowance in respect of, a supply of food, beverages or entertainment and subsection 67.1(1) of the Income Tax Act applies, or would apply if the registrant were a taxpayer under that Act, in respect of the supply or allowance, 50% of the total of all amounts, each of which is an input tax credit claimed in a return for a reporting period in a fiscal year of the registrant in respect of the supply or allowance, shall be added in determining the net tax

(a) where the registrant ceases in or at the end of that fiscal year to be registered under Subdivision d, for the last reporting period of the registrant in that fiscal year;

(b) where the reporting period of the registrant in that fiscal year is that fiscal year, for that reporting period; and

(c) in any other case, for the reporting period of the registrant that begins immediately after the end of that fiscal year.

Section 236 was renumbered as subsection 236(1) by S.C. 1994, c. 9, s. 14(1). The portion of subsection 236 preceding paragraph (a) was amended by S.C. 1993, c. 27, s. 97(1), effective December 17, 1990, and formerly read:

â€œ236. (1) Where a registrant is the recipient of, or pays an allowance in respect of, a supply of food, beverages or entertainment and subsection 67.1(1) of the Income Tax Act applies, or would apply if the registrant were a taxpayer under that Act, in respect of the supply or allowance, 20% of the total of all amounts, each of which is an input tax credit claimed in a return for a reporting period in a fiscal year of the registrant in respect of the supply or allowance, shall be added in determining the net tax

[5] The Appellant argues that this does not impose a tax. In this case the Appellant is a recipient of food and beverages of which 20% of the amounts, and after February, 1994, 50% of the amounts are added in determining the net tax. In the Court's view, subsection 236(1) describes the calculations which precede the imposition of the Part IX tax and on this basis the GST is properly imposed. This appeal is dismissed.

[6] The majority of the evidence concerns issue (a). The parties filed a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, which reads:

(yy) Agreed to by Mr. Unick on the basis that the Appellant disputes that it owes any tax.

[9] The Respondent did not admit that the basis for the assessment respecting parking was an allegation of employee benefits pursuant to paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, with a resultant GST adjustment pursuant to Section 173 of the Excise Tax Act. (See paragraphs 1.17 of the Notice of Appeal and 9 of the Reply.) Nor was there an assumption of a benefit to the employees.

[10] Larry Gruber, the auditor, reviewed Exhibit A-R 1, Tab 2, "Summary of Assessment" which states that parts of the assessment are for employee parking benefits. He further testified that the values assessed were based upon the difference between what he calculated to be the fair market value of the parking spaces and the amounts the employees paid. For parkades he calculated the fair market value on the basis of the rates at the Cornwall Parkade as described in assumption (nn). For parking lots, he used the rentals paid by the appellant as described in assumption (oo). Larry Gruber was not qualified as an expert witness in parking lot rates.

[11] The Appellant's evidence is that the employees who were provided parking stalls which remain subject to assessment did not have the use of particular stalls. They were expected by the Appellant to travel, from time to time, from their assigned offices in the course of various duties assigned to them by the Appellant in the course of their employment, which they did. On average this travel occurred on more than 30% of their working days. Their vehicles and they had access to that parking 24 hours a day, 7 days a week throughout the year. The subject employees could use the parking facilities after office hours for their personal use in their discretion. Their usage during office hours was for the benefit of the Appellant. The Appellant provided business parking and its employees used their own vehicles located in that parking for the Appellant's business from time to time as required by their duties. As a result, business travel occurred more quickly and efficiently. This benefited the Appellant, not the employees.

[12] However, each subject employee paid the Appellant the rates described and these rates constituted reimbursement for the personal aspect of their occasional use of the parking after office hours. Thus, any personal benefit was paid for in the rates levied on the employees by the Appellant.

[13] In the Court's view this is an evidentiary issue. The Appellant proved its contention respecting the parking. The Respondent did not prove that the employees received any personal benefit from the parking or that the rates it calculated represented either the correct value or the fair market value of the portion of the parking which constituted personal benefit to the employees. Rather, the Appellant and its employees were at arm's length and they made mutual deals respecting the parking in which each got consideration for what it gave.

[14] Thus, any value which an employee received was for that employee's occasional use of the parking facilities for shopping or entertainment similar to the personal use described by Mr. Unick. The Appellant and its employees agreed on a rate of payment by each employee that is commensurate with the personal parking value that those employees received. For this reason, this portion of the appeal is allowed.

[15] The assessments are referred back to the Minister accordingly.

[16] The Appellant is awarded party and party costs.
