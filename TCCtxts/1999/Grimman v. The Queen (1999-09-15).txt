REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

O'Connor, J.T.C.C.

[1] This appeal was heard at Toronto, Ontario on August 13, 1999 pursuant to the Informal Procedure of this Court. The relevant facts are as follows:

1. In computing her income for the 1990 taxation year the Appellant reported total income of $18,052.20, including employment income of $17,127.39 from her employer Re/Max Central Realty Inc. ("Re/Max"). After deducting various employment expenses of $16,072.14 her net income was $1,980.06 and her taxable income was nil.

2. The total amount of income tax withheld according to all T4s filed amounted to $11,254.75. Included in the T4's was one issued by Re/Max that contains only one figure indicating income tax deducted of $8,742.50. When one adds to the $11,254.75 certain tax credits the Appellant apparently became entitled to a refund of $14,087.07 which she received.

3. The Minister initially assessed the Appellant in July of 1991 as filed.

4. The Minister contends that the amount of $8,742.50 reported as tax withheld was in fact not tax withheld but actually consisted of further commission income from Re/Max.

5. Consequently and relying on subsection 152(4) of the Income Tax Act ("Act") the Minister reassessed the Appellant for the 1990 taxation year by notice thereof mailed May 22, 1996 to include the $8,742.50 as real estate commission received in the year and further disallowed the said amount as income tax withheld. The Minister also levied a penalty of $575.41 pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act in respect of the said $8,742.50 not reported as income.

[2] The first issue is whether the Appellant in filing her 1990 taxation year return made a misrepresentation that was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default as contemplated in subsection 152(4), thus enabling the Minister to assess beyond the three year period provided for in that subsection. The second issue is whether the Appellant must pay the penalty as provided for in subsection 163(2).

[3] The Respondent alleges that an amended T4 slip from Re/Max was also issued which simply showed the $8,742.50 as commission income with no deductions. The Appellant contends that she never received the amended T4 and there is evidence to support her in this regard besides her own statement. Apparently the amended T4 slip of Re/Max was only discovered recently in the possession of the Trustee of Bankruptcy of Re/Max. The Appellant states further that in the period in question, namely 1990 and early 1991, she was in "bad shape" essentially suffering from a depression. She states further that she only received the original T4 slip showing the amount as income tax withheld one or two days prior to the filing date of April 30, 1991, that she simply provided that along with her other information and slips to her accountant. The accountant prepared the return based on those slips and the return was filed. The Appellant adds that cheques representing commission income were only received sporadically, often sometime after the income was actually earned. She concludes that she could have been confused as to the erroneous T4.

[4] The Appellant concludes from all of the foregoing that she was not guilty of making a representation that was attributable to her neglect, carelessness or wilful default and that consequently the reassessment by the Minister in 1996 is statute barred. She filed her 1990 return in accordance with the T4 slips in her possession at that time.

[5] The Respondent points to the large amount of the refund and the fact that after claiming expenses on her original return the Appellant had negligible income and that the she should have been aware of the fact that there must have been a mistake in the T4 slip showing $8,742.50 as tax withheld. In other words she should have been alerted and consequently she made a misrepresentation. The Respondent also referred to a series of cheques received by the Apellant from Re/Max (Exhibit R-3) and concluded that the Appellant must have known that the original T4 slip was erroneous. The Minister contends further that there was gross negligence and that the penalties provided for in subsection 163(2) of the Act are applicable.

Analysis and Decision

[6] I accept the credibility of the Appellant including her testimony as to her depressed state in 1990 and 1991. The fact that she received the original slip showing that income tax withheld only at a very late date and relied on her accountant who filed on the basis of slips he had supports a conclusion that she did not wilfully misrepresent. Moreover, she never saw the amended T4. It should also be noted that the Minister was aware of the amended T4 in October of 1991 but only reassessed in 1996. In conclusion, based on all the evidence, the Appellant did not make a misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default as contemplated in subsection 152(4) of the Act. Having thus decided there is obviously no justification for the penalty imposed by the Minister.

[7] Consequently the appeal is allowed and the reassessment in question is vacated.
