REASONS FOR AMENDED JUDGMENT

Teskey, J.

[1] When I did the mathematics for the original judgments, I worked on the figures in the "Allowed" columns in Schedule "A" in the Replies to the Notices of Appeal. It slipped my attention that, although the Minister of National Revenue originally allowed those various amounts, he had taken away a portion thereof, which he called "Seasonal Proportion". At the opening of the hearing, counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that these amounts were wrongly disallowed and should be allowed, which I have now done in each of the years in question in the amended judgments.

[2] It should be noted that in regards to the year 1999, the appeal is now allowed in order to add back the so‑called seasonal proportion.

[3] Paragraph 8 of the Reasons refers to lump sum expenses of $12,836.00, which should have read $19,254.00, making the net profit for the year $15,176.00.

[4] In paragraph 48 of the Reasons, I referred to a deduction of $12,836.00 from gross income, this again should have read $19,254.00.

[5] Paragraph 61 of the Reasons should now read:

Since all expenses proven at the hearing for the year 1999, on all three properties, do not exceed the amount of expenses allowed in the assessment and conceded, totalling $19,254.00, the only remedy is to allow the appeal and give to the appellants each one‑half of the seasonal proportion that had been originally deducted, namely the sum of $6,418.00.

[6] Paragraph 62 of the Reasons is now wrong and should be ignored, as not having been written.

Signed at Kelowna, British Columbia, this 11th day of June, 2004.
