8. In computing income for the 1998 taxation year, the Appellant did not report any interest or other investment income.

9. In computing income for the 1999 taxation year, the Appellant claimed an allowable business investment loss (hereinafter "ABIL") in the 1999 taxation Year, calculated as follows:

Business Investment Loss (the "BIL") $69,615.00

x Â¾

ABIL $52,211.00

The claiming of the ABIL created a non-capital loss of $24,954.00 in the 1999 taxation year.

10. In computing income for the 2000 taxation year, the Appellant claimed a non-capital loss carry forward from the 1999 taxation year of $22,628.00.

12. The Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") reassessed the Appellant for the 1998 taxation year to include unreported interest income received of $516.00 earned on funds held in trust by his lawyer.

13. The Minister reassessed the Appellant for the 1999 taxation year by reducing the BIL to $52,649.00 and the ABIL to $39,487.00. This adjustment reduced the non-capital loss in the 1999 taxation year to $12,230.00

14. As the non-capital loss in the 1999 taxation year was reduced to $12,230.00, the Minister reassessed the Appellant for:

(b) the 2001 taxation year to disallow the non-capital loss carried forward from the 1999 taxation year.

15. The Notices of Reassessment outlined in paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 above for the 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 taxation years were dated April 22. 2002.

16. The Appellant filed a Notice of Objection to the 1999 and 2000 reassessments, dated July 18, 2002.

17. By letter dated April 2, 2003, the time period in which to file a Notice of Objection for the 1998 and 2001 taxation years was extended to the date of the letter and the Notice of Objection was deemed to be valid for the 1998 and 2001 taxation years.

18. In response to the Notices of Objection, the Minister confirmed the reassessments for the 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 taxation years by means of a Notification of Confirmation dated May 30, 2003.

19. The Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal to the Tax Court of Canada on November 5, 2003.

B. ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

21. The issues are:

(a) whether the interest income has been properly included in the Appellant's income in the 1998 taxation year;

(b) whether the amount of the BIL has been correctly calculated with respect to the 1999 taxation year;

(c) whether the non-capital loss incurred in the 1999 taxation year and carried forward to the 2000 taxation year has been correctly calculated; and

(d) whether there is any portion of the non-capital loss incurred in the 1999 taxation year available to be carried forward to the 2001 taxation year.

C. STATUTORY PROVISIONS, GROUNDS RELIED ON AND RELIEF SOUGHT

22. He relies on sections 3, 12 and 39, and subsections 50(1) and 248(1) and paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp) (the "Act") as amended for the 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 taxation years.

23. He submits that the interest income has been properly included in the Appellant's income in the 1998 taxation year by the Minister pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(c) of the Act.

24. He submits that the Minister correctly calculated the BIL of $52,649.20 pursuant to paragraph 39(1)(c) of the Act in respect of the 1999 taxation year.

25. He submits that the non-capital loss incurred in the 1999 taxation year and carried forward to the 2000 taxation year has been correctly calculated.

26. He further submits that as the entire non-capital loss incurred in the 1999 taxation year of $12,230.00 has been allowed in the 2000 taxation year pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Act, there is no amount remaining to carry forward to the 2001 taxation year pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Act.

[3] In the course of the trial, the Appellant admitted that the interest for 1998 described in paragraph 12 of the Reply was properly assessed.

[4] None of the assumptions in paragraph 20 were refuted and, in particular, the Respondent proved the calculations in subparagraph 20(w) to the satisfaction of the Court.

[5] During the hearing, the Appellant argued that it was for the Respondent to prove that the expenses claimed by him were not duplicates of expenses claimed and allowed by the Respondent in previous years. That is wrong. The law is that the Appellant bears the onus of proving his allegations in an income tax appeal as was described by the Supreme Court of Canada in Johnson v. MNR.

[6] The appeal is dismissed.

Signed at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, this 22nd day of December 2004.
