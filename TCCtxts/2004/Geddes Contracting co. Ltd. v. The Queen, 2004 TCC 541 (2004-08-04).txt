REASONS FOR ORDER

Bowie J.

[1] The trial of this matter took place in March 2003, at which time I reserved judgment. Almost immediately thereafter, the Appellant brought a motion to reopen the trial to admit additional documentary evidence that had not been available at the time of the trial. I allowed that motion and admitted an additional exhibit.[1] Before I could deliver judgment in the appeals, the Appellant moved again to reopen the trial, this time to raise the argument that one of the years under appeal was not open for the Minister to reassess as it was statute-barred. That motion was inspired by the decision of Bell J. in Agazarian v. The Queen.[2] Mr. Agazarian is a member of the same partnership as the Appellant in this case. On the hearing of that motion, it was agreed to by counsel that my decision on the motion should await the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the appeal from Bell J.'s decision that was scheduled to be heard in the near future. Since then the Federal Court of Appeal has allowed that appeal,[3] and Mr. Agazarian has applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal. Counsel in this appeal are agreed that I should now await the decision on that leave application before deciding the present case.

[2] In the meantime, some additional documentary evidence that was not available at the time of the trial in March 2003 has come into the hands of the Appellant. As a result, it has brought two further motions to reopen the trial to admit these additional documents into evidence. The documents are relevant, and they emanate from a third party without any collusion on the Appellant's part. They may well have a significant bearing on the outcome of the appeals. Counsel are agreed that if I reopen the hearing to admit them there is no need for additional oral evidence; the documents can simply be added to what is already a very substantial body of documentary evidence.

[3] I am of the view that these additional documents should be made part of the trial record, and that the hearing should be reopened for that limited purpose, for essentially the same reasons that I gave on the first motion to reopen.[4] An Order will therefore issue reopening the trial, solely to add to the evidence the documents that are Exhibits A to U to Affidavit #2 of Gordon Geddes sworn May 7, 2004, Exhibits A to D to Affidavit #3 of Gordon Geddes sworn May 12, 2004 and Exhibit A to Affidavit #4 of Gordon Geddes sworn June 2, 2004.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 4th day of August, 2004.
