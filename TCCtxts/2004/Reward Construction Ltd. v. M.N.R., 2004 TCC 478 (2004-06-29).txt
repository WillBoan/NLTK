REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Woods J.

[1] These are appeals by Simon Amyotte, his brother Charles Amyotte and their employer Reward Construction Ltd. from rulings in which the Minister of National Revenue decided that the brothers were engaged in insurable employment for purposes of the Employment Insurance Act during the 2001 calendar year. The appeals were heard together on common evidence.

[2] The shares of Reward Construction are owned by the brothers' parents, Real and Leona Amyotte. Reward Construction is engaged mostly as a concrete subcontractor on commercial and light industrial buildings. At the relavant time, the corporation employed several family members including the two brothers and approximately three arm's length persons. The father managed the business. Simon, 25 years of age, acted as supervisor on construction sites. Charles, 23 years of age, had a less senior position as a foreman but also acted as a right hand man to his brother. The two brothers lived in a house on a property where Reward Construction had a shop and stored the heavy equipment that it used.

[3] For purposes of determining whether a person is engaged in insurable employment under the Employment Insurance Act, the employment of a person who is related to the employer, as the two Amyotte brothers were, is excluded unless the Minister is satisfied that the terms of employment are substantially similar to arm's length terms.

[4] These appeals arose as a result of an application for a refund of employment insurance premiums by Simon and Charles Amyotte and Reward Construction. The Minister concluded that the terms and conditions were substantially arm's length and ruled that the employment was insurable.

Statutory provisions

[5] The relevant statutory provisions are contained in paragraphs 5(2)(i) and (3)(b) of the Employment Insurance Act which read:

(2) Insurable employment does not include

...

i) employment if the employer and employee are not dealing with each other at arm's length.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(i),

...

(b) if the employer is, within the meaning of that Act, related to the employee, they are deemed to deal with each other at arm's length if the Minister of National Revenue is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the employment, including the remuneration paid, the terms and conditions, the duration and the nature and importance of the work performed, it is reasonable to conclude that they would have entered into a substantially similar contract of employment if they had been dealing with each other at arm's length.

(emphasis added)

[6] This case was one of four similar appeals that I heard in Edmonton, Alberta over a one week period. In the reasons for another case, C & B Woodcraft Ltd., I commented generally on the scope of these provisions. I will not repeat that discussion here.

The Minister's determination

[7] The Minister concluded that Simon and Charles Amyotte were engaged in insurable employment because the terms and conditions of their employment were substantially similar to arm's length terms. The facts upon which the Minister relied are set out as assumptions of fact in the pleadings, and are attached as an appendix to these reasons.

[8] The father and the two sons all testified at the hearing. Based on their testimony, I conclude that the Minister did not take into account several facts that should have had a bearing on the decision. Some of these are:

- The Minister did not appreciate the amount of work that both brothers do to assist with the business, including maintaining the equipment, driving employees without cars to job sites, picking up materials and delivering it to the job sites, planning for the next day after the other employees go home, and discussing the status of work at night with their father. The father estimated that the boys worked approximately 65 hours per week whereas the Minister assumed a much more modest 44 to 50 hours for Simon Amyotte and 44 hours for Charles Amyotte.

- Since the Minister did not appreciate the number of hours that each of the brothers worked, he incorrectly assumed that their remuneration was in accordance with industry standards. Simon was paid an annual salary of $40,000, which presumably would not be in accordance with industry standards given the hours that he worked. Charles was paid an hourly wage of $16 but was only paid for the time recorded which was limited to the time on the job sites that the arm's length employees worked. The father suggested that Charles' hourly wage was high for someone of his seniority but I have discounted this testimony because Charles was very experienced, having worked with his father for over ten years.

- The Minister did not take into account the fact that Simon was paid during a two week holiday as well as receiving vacation pay for the same period. The father testified that this was due to inadvertence on his part but suggested that he would have been more careful with an arm's length employee.

- The Minister took into account that the sons could take time off without their employer's approval but the Minister did not take into account that the same latitude was not afforded the arm's length employees.

- The Minister correctly assumed that Reward Construction provided all the tools of the business but did not appreciate that the brothers used some of their own tools without reimbursement.

- The Minister did not take into account that the brothers lived on the same site as the shop where the equipment was stored and that they paid the utility bills for the shop without reimbursement.

- The Minister did not take into account that the bonuses to the two brothers were slightly higher than for the arm's length employees, $100 versus $200 or $300.

[9] Taken together, these factors indicate that the employment terms that the Minister considered were quite different from the actual terms and conditions of employment for each of Simon and Charles Amyotte. For that reason, I have concluded that the Minister's decision is not supportable.

Are employment terms arm's length

[10] In the appeal of Neeralta Welding & Sales Ltd. that I heard the same week, I commented that it is not suprising that the terms and conditions of employment in a small business tend to be significantly different for family members as opposed to arm's length employees. This case is no different. The main difference in the employment terms in this case is that Simon and Charles Amyotte worked considerably longer hours than arm's length workers would and the hours worked outside the normal work day were not remunerated. This cannot be considered substantially similar to arm's length employment terms.

Conclusion

[11] The appeals are allowed and the decision of the Minister that Simon and Charles Amyotte were engaged in insurable employment is vacated.
