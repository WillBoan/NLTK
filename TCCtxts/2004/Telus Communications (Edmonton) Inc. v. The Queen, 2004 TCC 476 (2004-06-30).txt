REASONS FOR ORDER

O'Connor, J.

[1] The Respondent in the Reply to the Amended Amended Notice of Appeal has joined issue on the question of penalties, which is the subject matter of the paragraphs the Appellant seeks to strike.

[2] Consequently in my opinion the said paragraphs do not constitute an abuse of the process of the Court. Therefore the Motion is dismissed. It is also my views that the matters raised in the Motion should later be determined by the trial judge.

[3] Costs are awarded to the Appellant in the amount of $1,000.00.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 30th day of June 2004.
