Favreau J.

Analysis and Conclusion

[5] The adjustments to ITCs made by the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”) in respect of the appellant’s 2005 and 2006 taxation years are as follows:

_________

$1,002.83

[6] The ITC adjustments resulted from adjustments to the appellant’s business expenses for the 2005 and 2006 taxation years. All income tax audit adjustments regarding the business expenses claimed by the appellant in the Year 2006 were also made in respect of the business expenses claimed by the appellant in the Year 2005 on the same basis and for the same reasons (either the expenses were not incurred in the course of commercial activities or were not corroborated by sufficient documentation).

[7] Considering my reasons and decision in the appellant’s income tax appeal (2012-911(IT)I), the appeal is allowed and the reassessment is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the appellant is entitled to an additional ITC in the amount of $219.32 for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2006, with adjustments to interest and penalties.
