REASONS FOR ORDER

(Show cause hearing called for hearing and decision rendered orally from the Bench on June 26, 2014 at Toronto, Ontario.)

Boyle J.

[1] In his Order of March 18, 2014, Justice D'Arcy ordered the Appellant Corporation to report to the Court by April 15, 2014, to advise which counsel has been retained. The Appellant did not comply with this Order.

[2] Furthermore, no one appeared on behalf of the Appellant at today's show cause hearing.

[3] The Appellant has also not communicated with the Court by way of motion to have someone else represent it nor has counsel of record been appointed. Therefore, this matter is dismissed without costs subject to my commitment to reinstate it if notice of counsel is filed within 30 days of this Order and subject to the taxpayer's right within 30 days to seek to have it reinstated for reasons the Court is not aware of at the present time.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada this 5th day of August 2014.
