REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

Masse D.J.

[1] This is an appeal from a reassessment issued on January 6, 2011, in respect of the 2009 taxation year. In that assessment, the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) disallowed a deduction of $7,972 from the appellant’s income with respect to his election to split pension income under section 60.03 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th suppl.), as amended (the Act).

Factual background

[2] The appellant, Jocelyn Cantin, was born on November 24, 1943, and is 69 years old. He graduated from the École polytechnique of the University of Montréal with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering in 1970. He began to work at Hydro‑Québec as an engineer in October 1978. Unfortunately, Mr. Cantin has been suffering from major depression since April 1994. He was treated with medication and psychiatric follow-up, but the effects of this illness on Mr. Cantin were such that he became unable to continue working. He is now at a therapeutic impasse, because no medication or therapy has been able to relieve his depression so he will be in a chronic state of depression for the rest of his life.

[3] Mr. Cantin became eligible for long-term disability benefits under an insurance policy contracted between Hydro‑Québec as the insured, and Industrial Alliance life insurance company (Industrial) as the insurer. A copy of the policy was filed with the Court as Exhibits A‑1 and I‑8. Mr. Cantin received those benefits until age 65.

[4] Mr. Cantin turned 65 in November 2008. Thus, under the provisions of the insurance policy, the long-term wage loss benefits ended on November 30, 2008, and were replaced with pension supplement payments in accordance with the provisions of clause 5-C(b) of the insurance policy (Exhibit A‑1). Mr. Cantin has been receiving the pension supplement since December 2008.

[5] This case concerns the 2009 taxation year. For that taxation year, Desjardins Trust issued to the appellant a T4RIF “Statement of Income from a Registered Retirement Income Fund” for $10,485.85 (see Exhibit I‑2). Industrial issued a T4A slip “Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity and Other Income” for $15,953.76 (see Exhibit I‑3). Mr. Cantin does not dispute those amounts as income. The total of those two sources of income, according to the T4RIF (Exhibit I‑2) and T4A (Exhibit I‑3) slips is: $10,485.85 + $15,953.76 = $26,439.62.

[6] Mr. Cantin wanted to split his pension income between him and his wife. The effect of splitting his income was to reduce his income by the split amount and that amount was then added to his wife’s income. Because the income of Mr. Cantin’s wife was lower than that of Mr. Cantin, her income was taxable at a lower rate than that of Mr. Cantin. The result of the pension income split was that the couple was required to pay less in taxes as a couple. Thus, Mr. Cantin and his wife jointly completed Form T1032 in electing to split pension income and calculated $13,218 as being the split-pension amount (see Exhibit I‑1, line 116).

[7] According to Marlène Bourcier, Appeals Officer with the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA), that amount consists in part of benefits paid to Mr. Cantin as disability insurance or income maintenance insurance. The CRA is of the view that the amount of $15,973.76 paid to Mr. Cantin in disability insurance by Industrial is not qualified to be split pursuant to the provisions of the Act. Only the amount of $10,485.85 paid to Mr. Cantin by Desjardins Trust as income from a Registered Retirement Income Fund is eligible to be split. Thus, only the amount of $5,242 could be split and attributed to Mr. Cantin’s wife. Therefore, the CRA made adjustments to Mr. Cantin’s income to ensure the amount $7,976 (the difference between $13,218, which is the amount that Mr. Cantin wants to split, and $5,242, which is the amount eligible to be split) was added to his income.

[8] Ginette Larivière is employed by Industrial. Her task is to act as a liaison between Industrial and its lawyers in all cases involving Industrial. Apparently, there have been a number if disputes between Industrial and Hydro‑Québec, on the one hand, and the appellant, on the other. Ms. Larivière explained to us that Industrial is a life insurance company that is responsible for managing Hydro‑Québec’s long-term disability insurance plan. Industrial is not at all responsible for Hydro‑Québec’s retirement plan. Ms. Larivière testified that all amounts paid to Mr. Cantin during 2009 were paid under a long-term disability insurance plan and not under a pension plan. In 2009, Industrial paid Mr. Cantin $15,953.76, which is the same amount indicated on the T4A slip as disability insurance benefits. Industrial is neither the administrator of Hydro‑Québec’s pension plan nor the insurer of the pension plan. There is no connection between Industrial and the Hydro‑Québec pension funds. All benefits paid to Mr. Cantin under the disability insurance plan are derived exclusively from Industrial and not Hydro‑Québec.

Appellant’s position

[9] In his Notice of Appeal, the appellant submits that the payments that were made to him by Industrial constitute retirement pension although those payments are not from a pension fund within the meaning of subsection 118(7) of the Act, and therefore, the payments are deductible for income splitting purposes under section 60.03 of the Act. The appellant submits that the benefits that are paid to him by Industrial constitute an annuity for services already rendered and are, therefore, a life annuity and not disability insurance benefits. This pension annuity continues without disruption until his death. Both the insurance policy and the plan administered by Industrial were intended only as a tool by which Hydro‑Québec provides an income to employees with disabilities.

Respondent’s position

[10] The respondent submits that payments received from an income maintenance insurance plan are not in any way a pension. The amount of $15,953 that the appellant received from Industrial does not represent qualified pension income under subsection 118(7) of the Act. Accordingly, that amount does not qualify for pension income splitting under section 60.03 of the Act. For income to truly qualify for pension splitting under subsection 118(7) of the Act, it is necessary that the income be pension income; that is to say, a pension plan and not a disability insurance plan. Since the amount indicated on the T4A slip represents income maintenance insurance, that income does not qualify for splitting as a pension plan.

. . .

Analysis

[12] The issue is whether payments received from a long-term disability insurance plan is qualified pension income with respect to the elected split-pension amount for the appellant. In my opinion, the answer to that question is clearly no.

[13] According to the provisions of the Act, the following is pension income qualifying for income splitting:

▪ the taxable portion of payments in respect of a life annuity under a superannuation plan, a pension fund or pension plan;

▪ if payments are received as a consequence of the death of a spouse or common-law partner or if the pensioner is 65 or older at the end of the year:

(a) annuity payments and payments out of or under a registered retirement income fund (including a life income fund);

(b) annuity payments under a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP).

[14] Do the payments paid to the appellant in accordance with the insurance policy possess the qualities of a pension qualifying for pension income splitting within the meaning of section 60.03 and subsection 118(7) of the Act? The insurance policy (Exhibit A‑1) is described as a [Translation] “Group health policy: monthly income in the event of long-term disability”. Industrial is described as being [Translation] “the Insurer” and Hydro‑Québec is described as being [Translation] “the Insured”. The appellant is an [Translation] “employee” within the meaning of the phrase used in clause 1 of the policy. According to clause 2 of the policy, [Translation] “any person who meets the definition of ‘employee’ is eligible for insurance hereunder. . .”. Clause 3 refers to the [Translation] “start of the insurance”. The purpose of the insurance is set out in clause 4:

[Translation]

The Insurer pays a pension annuity in the amounts and in the manner provided in clauses 5—and 6—below, to any Employee insured hereunder who is totally disabled.

[15] Clause 5 refers to a [Translation] “waiting period”, “benefit period”, “benefit amount” before and after the normal retirement age, which is 65, and the terms of payment of the annuity. Clause 6 provides for the waiver of premiums for an insured disabled employee during the period when an annuity is paid to the employee under the insurance policy. Clauses 14 and 15 refer to [Translation] “[the]due date, calculation and modification of premiums” and “payment of premiums”. Clause 16 refers to an insurance [Translation] “contract” between the parties. Clause 19 covers the manner in which an employee may file a claim for benefits, the evidence needed to support a claim, the fact that the insurer has the right to require the individual to whom the claim pertains to attend a physician of its choice, and the payment of benefits or compensation provided for in the insurance policy.

[16] A close reading of the insurance policy shows that the contractual intention between Industrial and Hydro‑Québec was to establish a long-term disability insurance plan for the benefit of Hydro‑Québec employees. It is income maintenance insurance. There is nothing in the wording of the insurance policy that indicates an intention to create any type of pension plan. The fact that the insurance provides that benefits continue to be paid after age 65 in the form of a retirement pension supplement cannot convert disability benefits into retirement pension payments. The payments made in accordance with the terms of the insurance policy are not provided by a superannuation plan, a pension fund, a pension plan, a registered retirement income fund or RRSP.

Conclusion

[17] I find that the payments received from a long-term disability insurance plan do not qualify for pension income splitting. Even though the wage loss benefits ended when the appellant reached the age of 65, they were replaced by retirement pension supplement payments. This does not change the fact that the appellant continues to receive disability insurance benefits even after having reached the age of 65. The amount of $15,953.76 that the appellant received from Industrial does not represent qualified pension income within the meaning of subsection 118(7) of the Act. Accordingly, this amount does not create an entitlement for pension income splitting under section 60.03 of the Act.

[18] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.
