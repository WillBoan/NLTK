Reasons for judgment

Charron, D.J.T.C.C.

[1] These appeals were heard on common evidence at Montréal, Quebec, on February 16, 2001, to determine whether the decisions by the Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") that the employment of Denis Chénard during the period from January 1997 to February 26, 1999, and of Peter Bambic during the period from June 1996 to February 26, 1999, with Services Techniques Géonordic Inc., the payer, was insurable within the meaning of the Employment Insurance Act (the "Act"), are correct.

[2] By letters dated November 16, 1999, the Minister informed the appellants that the employment in question was insurable on the ground that it met the requirements for a contract of service and that there was an employer-employee relationship between them and the payer.

Denis Chénard's Testimony

[5] Mr. Chénard is a geological engineer and member of the Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec (Quebec association of engineers), to which he has paid registration fees ever since he has been working for himself as a geological consultant. Prior to January 1997, he worked as an employee for Mine Aurizon. He has since founded a registered company under the firm name Datac Géo-Conseil enrg., having a place of business at 289 Chemin Val-du-Repos, Val-Senneville, Quebec. Mr. Chénard specializes in the evaluation of copper, zinc, gold and other mineral deposits, which work he did for Services Techniques Géonordic Inc., the payer, and has carried out specific mandates for Exploration Boréal and Mines d'or Virginia without a written contract. The payer assigned him specific mandates and allowed him to accept others. The payer, for its part, had no obligation to provide work. Mr. Chénard set his work schedules and his fees and determined his work methods. He was free to accept or turn down any mandate offered to him. He was paid by the day, receiving payment every two or three weeks or monthly, in accordance with the requirements of the invoices sent to the payer, Mines d'or Virginia or Exploration Boréal (Exhibit A-1) and upon submission of reports to the clients concerned (Exhibit A-2). The field work was performed on the clients' sites. Most of the time, the reports were drafted at Datac Géo-Conseil enr.'s office, but this was also done at the payer's office whenever it was necessary to facilitate meetings with the drawing technicians. The equipment such as computers, the necessary software to perform the work, geologist's hammers, backpacks, GPS units, stone saws, chainsaws and the truck were acquired by the appellant Chénard at a cost of approximately $60,000; he bore the maintenance and insurance costs with respect thereto. The larger equipment, such as camp equipment, drilling machines and motor boats, was supplied by the payer. Mr. Chénard was entitled to no fringe benefits and no sick leave or vacation leave. He had to pay his office maintenance expenses and electricity, heating and training expenses. He also had to pay the GST and QST. It is impossible for geological engineers to acquire the large equipment because it is too costly. The truck was rented on a per-kilometer basis ($0.40) and the computer equipment was rented at $10 a day. Mr. Chénard earned $80,000 a year, 90 percent of which came from the payer. He could not carry out alone the type of mandate he was given. His meals were provided to him when he was in the field. A 5,000- or 10,000-meter drilling program could cost from $100,000 to $200,000.

Peter Bambic's Testimony

[6] Mr. Bambic is a geological engineer and resides at 105 Rue Cotnoir, Évain, Quebec. He is a member of the Association des géologues et géophysiciens du Québec (Quebec association of geologists and geophysicists) and of the Geological Association of Canada, to both of which he pays dues. He is also a lithography specialist and has worked for Barrett Gold and Inco. From 1996 to 1999, he worked for the payer, Virginia, Ormico, Osisco, Gordy Enricson and the Cree Nation of Wemindji. He never had a contract with the payer, but obtained mandates from that company. He was free to do as he wished, when he wished, and the payer had no obligation to provide him with work. Mr. Bambic set his remuneration at $350 a day, which he reduced to $300 to please such a big client, but soon realized that was a mistake. He now asks for fixed remuneration payable on receipt of an invoice. Mr. Bambic did not need to visit a site: he relied on what he saw and set a reasonable price. He then had to make ad hoc reports to the clients of Boréal or Virginia, but there was no such requirement with respect to the payer. In the payer's case, a report at the end of the project was sufficient. Mr. Bambic supplied a computer, a desk, a truck, a snowmobile, camping equipment, tents, walkie-talkies, stoves, and power saws worth approximately $1,000. He used all kinds of things that belonged to him and was reimbursed his expenses for the use of his truck on a per-kilometer basis. Only when he incurred hotel and restaurant expenses did he request reimbursement from his client, but he never claimed anything if he camped and used his own equipment. He asked for no fringe benefits from the payer and had neither sick leave nor vacation leave. He himself paid for his wage loss insurance, training courses, life insurance and liability insurance. He had no employees or costly machinery, and had to pay any QST and GST.

Jean-François Ouellette's Testimony

[7] Mr. Ouellette, a geologist, like the two appellants, is the president of the payer and resides at 1112 Ranges 9 and 10 East in Bellecombe, Quebec. The payer is a mining exploration company which performs work for companies listed on the stock exchange with a view to finding metalliferous deposits of gold, copper, zinc and other metals. Seventy percent of that work is done in northern Quebec, in areas where there are often no roads and that are accessible only by air. The payer employs approximately 10 to 35 employees, depending on the season. From June 1996 to February 1999, the company was overwhelmed with work and called on Messrs. Chénard and Bambic because they are mining and mining exploration specialists. They have special skills and the company cannot afford to employ such people year-round. Dealings with them take place orally with respect to both salary and the work to be done. The payer had no obligation to provide these consultants with work. They were completely free to accept or to refuse any mandate for any reason whatever in order to protect the aura of secrecy surrounding them. These persons controlled their schedules themselves; they were professionals who made their own decisions and determined themselves their work methods. They accepted no control whatever. Their remuneration was the result of a common agreement reached following negotiations. The consultants supplied their personal equipment, their computer equipment, their vehicles and other such things. Large items such as helicopters and camp equipment were provided by the payer because they were too costly: in most cases, it costs $25,000 to $40,000 to get set up at a site and the payer assumes those costs. The payer also provided its employees with all their work equipment, from pencils to vehicles (a truck, snowmobiles and so on). Messrs. Chénard and Bambic were responsible for maintenance of their employees' tools. The relationship between the payer and its employees was as provided for in a written contract which stipulates their hours of work, leave days, fringe benefits and wages and includes an undertaking of confidentiality. Between the consultants and the payer, there was no agreement on fringe benefits, sick leave and vacation, nor was there any training plan. The payer paid for its employees' training courses, leave and travel. The consultants themselves were in control of their time when they were in the forest. Similarly, the consultants' employees were supervised by the consultants themselves and they worked seven or eight hours a day. All meals were provided at no cost to the consultants' employees and to the payer's employees at the client's expense. Messrs. Chénard and Bambic were paid by the payer on submission of an invoice.

Analysis of the Facts in Relation to the Act

[8] The case law has established four essential tests for recognizing a contract of employment. The decisive case in this area is City of Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive Works Ltd., [1947] 1 D.L.R. 161. The tests in question are as follows: (1) control, (2) ownership of the tools, (3) chance of profit and risk of loss, and (4) the degree of integration, this last test having been added by the Federal Court of Appeal in Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1986] 3 F.C. 553. This list is not exhaustive however.

[9] The evidence showed that the work performed by the appellants was done under the payer's direction and that there was no relationship of subordination between them. The payer managed the business and owned the machines and tools necessary for its operation. The payer alone could realize profits or incur losses in the operation of its business; the appellants could not as they received only a fixed fee. Lastly, the appellants performed their work in the field and were well integrated into the business. I therefore conclude for the following reasons that the payer operated a business and that the appellants were employed by it during the periods in issue.

[10] Mr. Chénard is a geological engineer and a member of the Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec (Quebec association of engineers), to which he pays dues. He is a specialist in the evaluation of mineral deposits and carried out specific mandates for the payer, Boréal and Virginia, without a written contract. He was permitted to accept other mandates. He set his hours of work and his fees and determined his work methods. He was remunerated upon submission of his invoices and a final report to the clients concerned. The field work was performed on the clients' land. The equipment such as computers and the necessary software, geologist's hammers, backpacks, stone saws, chainsaws, the truck and other tools were acquired by Mr. Chénard at a cost of $60,000. He was entitled to no fringe benefits, sick leave or vacation. He paid his office expenses and had to pay the GST and QST. The large equipment and the truck were leased and the rental was paid by Mr. Chénard.

[11] Mr. Bambic is likewise a geological engineer and a lithography specialist as well. He has also worked for Barrett Gold, Inco and the payer, without a written contract. He was free to do what he wanted, and the payer had no obligation to provide him with work. Mr. Bambic set his remuneration at $300 a day and claimed payment by submitting an invoice. He did not need to visit a site in advance: he set a price which he felt was reasonable and, with the exception of a final report, never made any report to the payer. He supplied his computer, a truck, a snowmobile, camping equipment, tents, stoves, walkie-talkies, and power saws worth $1,000 and was reimbursed his expenses for the use of the truck. He was also reimbursed his hotel and restaurant expenses, if any. He was not entitled to any fringe benefits, sick leave or vacation leave. He paid his wage loss insurance, life insurance and liability insurance premiums, his training course costs and any GST and QST. He had no employees.

[12] In the Court's view, the appellants Chénard and Bambic were self-employed workers; therefore, the appeals are allowed and the Minister's decisions vacated.
