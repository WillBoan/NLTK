Reasons for Judgment

Teskey J.

[1] The Appellant herein appealed a determination of income for the purposes of the calculation of his guaranteed income supplement to the Review Tribunal pursuant to subsection 28(2) of the Old Age Security Act (the « Act » ). The Commissioner of the Review Tribunal referred this matter to the Court.

Facts

[2] There are no facts is dispute.

Arguments

[3] The Appellant argues that I should take into consideration the spirit and intent of the Act and note that it predates the Home Buyers' Plan provisions of the Income Tax Act.

[4] The Supreme Court of Canada has made it abundantly clear that when interpreting tax statutes, the Court must look at the wording and only if the wording is not clear or ambiguous should the Court look at the spirit or intent of the statute.

[5] Unfortunately for the Appellant, the Act and the income tax provisions are clear and unambiguous.

[6] The argument put forward by the agent for the Respondent on the provisions, before or on the calculator for the Appellant's income for the purposes of the Act, is correct and adopted by me.

[7] The appeal is dismissed.
