Reasons for Judgment

Beaubier, J.T.C.C.

[1] This appeal pursuant to the Informal Procedure was heard at Lethbridge, Alberta on May 17, 2001. The appeal proceeded on agreed facts and exhibits filed by agreement.

[2] The issue before the Court is whether the Appellant should have included as her income for 1998 the sum of $4,200 paid by her former husband, Richard Gibson, as child support for their daughter, Kim, who was in the custody of the Appellant.

[3] On August 8, 1996 the Gibsons completed "Minutes of Settlement" in which Mr. Gibson agreed to pay child support of $500 per month for Kim commencing July 1, 1996 (Paragraph 3(a)).

[4] In this agreement:

1. Page 1 stated that the divorce action had been commenced as Number 4806010696, Queen's Bench, Lethbridge.

2. Page 1 stated that the agreement is subject to the approval of the Court in respect to custody and maintenance.

3. Gail was granted custody of the infant children of the marriage (Paragraph 2). Kim was born June 30, 1981.

4. The parties agreed that if the Federal legislation enacted non-tax deductible child support, the support payment for Kim would drop to $325 per month (Paragraph 3(b)).

[5] On December 17, 1996 Richard Gibson was ordered to pay Gail $350 per month support for Kim by Yanosik J. of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench.

[6] On January 16, 1998, the divorce judgment of Langston J. of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench stated:

CLERK OF THE COURT

THE SPOUSES ARE NOT FREE TO REMARRY UNTIL THIS JUDGMENT TAKES EFFECT, AT WHICH TIME EITHER SPOUSE MAY OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE FROM THIS COURT. IF AN APPEAL IS TAKEN FROM THIS JUDGMENT, IT MAY DELAY THIS JUDGMENT TAKING EFFECT.

[7] Langston J.'s judgment of January 16, 1998:

1. Is the first order of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench which granted custody of Kim to Gail (Paragraph 2); and

2. Refers to an "acknowledgement" that the amounts owing under Yanosik J.'s order shall be paid (Paragraph 5).

[8] Pursuant to subsection 56.1(4) of the Income Tax Act, the commencement day for a support order is defined as:

"commencement day" at any time of an agreement or order means

(a) where the agreement or order is made after April 1997, the day it is made; and

(b) where the agreement or order is made before May 1997, the day, if any, that is after April 1997 and is the earliest of

(i) the day specified as the commencement day of the agreement or order by the payer and recipient under the agreement or order in a joint election filed with the Minister in prescribed form and manner,

(ii) where the agreement or order is varied after April 1997 to change the child support amounts payable to the recipient, the day on which the first payment of the varied amount is required to be made,

(iii) where a subsequent agreement or order is made after April 1997, the effect of which is to change the total child support amounts payable to the recipient by the payer, the commencement day of the first such subsequent agreement or order, and

(iv) the day specified in the agreement or order, or any variation thereof, as the commencement day of the agreement or order for the purposes of this Act.

[9] However, the "order" which subsection 56.1(4) deals with is an "order ... for the benefit of ... children in the taxpayer's custody" as described in subsection 56.1(1). That order is the order of Yanosik, J. and is merely "acknowledged" for the purposes of Langston, J.'s order. It was not varied by Langston J's order.

[10] For this reason, the appeal is dismissed.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada this 28th day of May 2001.
