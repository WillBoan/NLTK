Reasons for Judgment

Bell, J.T.C.C.

[1] This is an appeal by the Appellant from an award of costs in an Informal Procedure case, the Reasons for Taxation and Certificate of Costs being dated July 1, 2001.

[2] The Appellant's appeal before this Court was allowed with costs. He submitted a Bill of Costs in the amount of $6,275.55. This represents the total of two bills given to the Appellant by Robinson & Company, Chartered Accountants, for research and allied services in respect of the Appellant's appeal. The Appellant made much of his position that he was not represented by the accountants and that the bill did not constitute representation costs. That is patently inaccurate. The Registrar of this Court, at the commencement of the hearing of the appeal on June 16, 1995 said, without interruption or objection from the Appellant:

The Appellant is represented by agent Grant Robinson ...

Mr. Robinson then advised the Court that he was a chartered accountant and proceeded with the introduction of documentary evidence and the examination of the Appellant and conduct of the case.

[3] The taxing officer stated that the expenses claimed were described as "disbursements" and that the activities were consistent with those services performed by and allowable to counsel, but not to an agent. He said:

Each invoice shows hourly charges and does not address specific information, for example the number of copies or the charge per copy. An allocation of hours to perform general functions does not make it possible to determine the reasonableness and necessity of the activity and associated expense essential for the conduct of the appeal.

[4] Finally, the taxing officer said that having considered the evidence and submissions of both parties:

The amount claimed of $6,275.55 is taxed off.

[5] At the hearing the Appellant submitted that he was claiming "only the actual disbursements incurred". He said:

Section 12(3) of the Informal Procedure Rules provides for amounts that are allowed in an award of costs. This section is separate from section 11 by number and intent. It allows costs in addition to any party and party costs allowable under section 11. Section 12 is not concerned with party and party costs which are described separately in section 11. ... The disbursement costs that are detailed in the Bill of Costs are an itemized listing of out-of-pocket expenses that were necessary in order to conduct this appeal. The fact that a number of individuals at an accounting management firm undertook these required tasks of research, photocopying, collating, organizing, requesting files, typing, mailing, telephoning, purchasing, etc., rather than my buying each of these tasks one at time or actually doing these tasks myself does not alter the fact that these were out-of-pocket expenses incurred in order to conduct the appeal.

[6] Subsection 18.26(1) of the Tax Court of Canada Act provides, in certain circumstances, that the Court may award costs to the Appellant in accordance with the Rules of Court. I simply awarded costs without fixing any sum.

[7] Section 11. of the Informal Procedure Rules ("Rules") provides the fees which "may be allowed for services of counsel".

[8] Subsection 12.(1) provides for amounts paid to an ordinary witness. Subsection (2) provides the amounts payable in respect of an expert witness. Subsection (3) reads:

Such other disbursements may be allowed as were essential for the conduct of this appeal, if it is established that the disbursements were made or that the party is liable for them.

[10] The Federal Court of Appeal in Her Majesty the Queen v. Linda Munro, 98 DTC 6443 concluded that the words "such other disbursements" in Rule 12(3) cannot be interpreted to include fees for services of agents. At 6447 the Court said:

The informal procedure set out in the Act specifically contemplates in section 18.14 representation by an agent; yet the Rules Committee has expressly restricted the taxable fees to those relating to "services of counsel". It does violence to the very clear intent in Rule 11 of restricting fees to services of counsel to suggest that the words "such other disbursements" in Rule 12(3) can be interpreted in such a way as to include fees for services of agents and furthermore to allow such agents the right to claim whatever they want beyond and above what counsel are allowed to claim. Agents should not be allowed to claim indirectly under Rule 12(3) what has been directly denied to them in Rule 11.

[11] Each and every item in the two bills reproduced above relates to preparation for an appeal to this Court. I conclude that the Appellant's circumstances fall clearly within the above Federal Court of Appeal description. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada this 16th day of March, 2001.
