B. ISSUE TO BE DECIDED

9. The issue to be decided in this appeal is whether the Appellant is required to use the Simplified Method when calculating its net tax for the reporting periods ending during the relevant period.

[2] The "simplified method" which the Respondent alleges to be applicable to the Appellant arises from amendments which created section 225.1 of the Excise Tax Act in 1997 by c. 10, s. 45 for periods beginning after 1996. Thus the legislation was retroactive. In particular, the first three lines of subsection (2) and subsections (6) and (7) read:

(2) Net tax -

Subject to subsection (7), the net tax for a particular reporting period of a charity that is a registrant is equal to the positive or negative amount determined by the formula ...

(6) Election -

Where a charity that makes supplies outside Canada, or zero-rated supplies, in the ordinary course of a business or all or substantially all of whose supplies are taxable supplies elects not to determine its net tax in accordance with subsection (2), that subsection does not apply in respect of any reporting period of the charity during which the election is in effect.

(7) Form and content of election -

An election under subsection (6) by a charity shall

(a) be filed in prescribed manner with the Minister in prescribed form containing prescribed information;

(b) set out the day the election is to become effective, which day shall be the first day of a reporting period of the charity;

(c) remain in effect until a revocation of the election becomes effective; and

(d) be filed

(i) where the first reporting period of the charity in which the election is in effect is a fiscal year of the charity, on or before the first day of the second fiscal quarter of that year or such later day as the Minister may determine on application of the charity, and

(ii) in any other case, on or before the day on or before which the return of the charity is required to be filed under this Division for the first reporting period of the charity in which the election is in effect or on such later day as the Minister may determine on application of the charity.

[3] Subsection (2)'s method set out for calculation is subject to subsection (7) by express wording. Subsection (7) does not authorize the election to continue with the old method of determination. Rather, that authorization is in subsection (6).

[4] Subsection (7) describes the particulars relating to the election mechanics, and prescribes the

1. manner of filing

2. the form, and

3. the information.

[5] "Prescribed" is defined in subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act as follows:

"prescribed" means

(a) in the case of a form or the manner of filing a form, authorized by the Minister,

(b) in the case of the information to be given on a form, specified by the Minister,

(c) in the case of the manner of making or filing an election, authorized by the Minister, and

(d) in any other case, prescribed by regulation or determined in accordance with rules prescribed by regulation;

[6] In this case subsection 225.1(7) is to be complied with as authorized or specified by the Minister. However, the Appellant did not file an election with the Minister, according to assumption 8(g).

[7] In these circumstances, as sympathetic as the Court might be with a charitable or similar organization whose work such as GST filings is usually done by volunteers without any reward, the Court is compelled to deny the appeal.

[8] Therefore the appeal is dismissed.

Signed at Regina, Saskatchewan, this 18th day of April, 2001.
