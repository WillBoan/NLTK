PATRICK VILLENEUVE,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

Reasonsfor Taxation

Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing on July 10, 2001, by means of a telephone conference call. It follows an Amended Judgment of the Honourable Judge McArthur dated January 13, 2000, wherein costs were awarded to the Respondent. The Appellant represented himself and Ms. Rosemary Fincham represented the Respondent.

[2] The Bill of Costs as submitted by the Respondent is as follows:

Item No. Item Fees Disbursements

B1(1)a Services prior to Examination

for discovery $ 375.00

1(1)b Motion for Particulars

April 9, 1998 $ 375.00

B1(1)b Motion to Amend Reply to

Amended Notice of Appeal $ 375.00

B1(1)b Status hearing

(1236 x .20) $ 274.20



TOTAL FEES $3,875.00

TOTAL DISBURSEMENTS $ 274.20

SUBTOTAL $4,122.20



[3] It should be noted that Mr. Villeneuve requested that his wife, who is not a lawyer, represent him on this taxation of costs. That request was denied, on the basis that Mrs. Villeneuve does not fall within the definition of "counsel" as set out in subsection 17.1(2) of the Tax Court of Canada Act.

[4] Ms. Fincham reviewed each item claimed for counsel fees on the Bill of Costs. She submitted that the amount claimed for counsel fees totalling $3,875.00 was in accordance with Schedule II, Tariff B of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure).

[5] Ms. Fincham stated that the claim for disbursements totalling $274.20, represented the cost of photocopying the Respondent's pleadings, productions and books of authorities. The total copies made totalled 1,236 pages at the rate of $.20 per page.

[6] Mr. Villeneuve's submissions were brief. He submitted that he did not believe that the Respondent was entitled to costs and did not agree with the submissions made by Ms. Fincham. Furthermore, he stated that when he was in Court the Judge "disallowed the costs".

[7] Ms. Fincham made a brief reply to the Appellant's submissions. She stated that the Judgment of the Court was clear. Costs were awarded to the Respondent and as such, the costs claimed by the Respondent should be allowed.

[8] I agree with Ms. Fincham. The Court's Judgment is clear in awarding costs to the Respondent. The amounts claimed for counsel fees are in accordance with Schedule II, Tariff B and are allowed in the full amount of $3,875.00.

[9] With respect to the claim for photocopies, I am satisfied that the copies made were necessary for the conduct of the appeal. I will allow the full amount claimed of 1,236 copies at $.20 per page, for a total of $247.20, not $274.20, as set out in the Bill of Costs.

[10] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and the amount of $4,122.20 is allowed. A certificate in that amount will be issued.

Dated at Toronto, Ontario this 14th day of September 2001.
