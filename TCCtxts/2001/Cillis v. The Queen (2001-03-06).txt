Reasonsfor Judgment

Tardif, J.T.C.C.

[1] This is an appeal for the 1992 and 1993 taxation years. The burden of proof was on the appellant.

[2] In support of his appeal, the appellant basically indicated that he paid an accountant a few hundred dollars in fees every year to have him do various compilations and prepare on his behalf the relevant returns for both levels of government.

[3] He stated that he consequently did not understand the reason for the assessment and above all that he was unable to pay anything as life was very difficult for him.

[4] In response to the Court's questions, the appellant admitted that he was indeed a self-employed worker at the time of the facts on which the assessment is based.

[5] Since the appellant did not adduce any relevant evidence against the assessment at issue in this appeal, his testimony having served mainly to describe his very limited ability to pay, the Court must dismiss the appeal.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 6th day of March 2001.
