REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, Taxing Officer, T.C.C.

[1] This matter was heard by way of telephone conference call on Wednesday, September 28, 2011. Following the dismissal of the appeals in these matters, the Honourable Madam Justice Campbell issued Reasons respecting costs on December 1, 2010, wherein the Respondent was awarded costs and disbursements. The Appellant represented himself and Mr. John Grant represented the Respondent.

[2] The counsel fees claimed on the Respondent’s Revised Amended Bill of Costs totalled $6,625.00 which included $525.00 for this taxation of costs and disbursements of $1,191.98.

[3] Mr. Palonek agreed to the counsel fees claimed under items 1(1)(a), 1(1)(b) and 1(1)(g) in the total amount of $1,300.00. Mr. Palonek agreed to the amount claimed for photocopies totalling $500.98. Mr. Grant withdrew the $71.00 claimed for process server fees.

[4] The counsel fees in dispute between the parties are Items 1(1)(h), conduct of the hearing, 1(1)(i) services after judgment and 1(1)(d), taxation of costs. The only disbursement in dispute is the amount of $620.00 representing the cost of transcripts of the hearing, incorrectly identified as discovery transcripts on the Bill of Costs.

Item No. 1(1)(h)

[5] Mr. Palonek submitted that the hearing in this matter took place over three days, but could have been completed in two. He stated that on the second day of the hearing, one of his witnesses brought several documents which needed to be copied. Copies of the documents could not be made, as the photocopy machine in the court house was not functioning, necessitating the adjournment of the hearing.

[6] Mr. Grant stated that the transcript of the hearing of the second day of hearing did not contain any indication that the hearing was adjourned, due to the unavailability of a photocopy machine. According to his review of the transcript, the hearing was adjourned, due to the unavailability of one of Mr. Palonek’s witnesses.

[7] Mr. Grant argued that the amount claimed for conduct of the hearing was in accordance with the Tariff. He further submitted that the hearing took place over a period of three days and the Respondent was entitled to recover a counsel fee for each day of the hearing or part thereof in the amount of $4,500.00.

[8] I reviewed the transcript of the second day of the hearing and found no reference to the Court granting an adjournment, due to the unavailability of a photocopy machine. My review was consistent with Mr. Grant’s submission, that the hearing was adjourned due to the unavailability of Mr. Palonek’s witness. The Tariff permits the allowance of $1,500.00 per day or part thereof for conduct of the hearing and I will allow $4,500.00 under Item No. 1(1)(h).

Item No. 1(1)(i)

[9] Mr. Palonek’s dispute of the $300.00 claimed for services rendered after judgment was on the basis that the amount was excessive.

[10] Mr. Grant stated the counsel fee for services after judgment related to services associated with client reporting, closing of the file and preparing materials for storage. He further stated that the amount claimed was in accordance with the Tariff, which amount should be allowed.

[11] The $300.00 claimed under Item no. 1(1)(i) is a Tariff item which the Respondent is entitled to recover. I will accordingly allow the $300.00 claimed.

Item No. 1(1)(c)

[12] Mr. Palonek stated that he attempted to make arrangements to pay the Respondent’s costs, without success. He further submitted that he was not aware that this taxation would take place and that the scheduling of it came as a surprise. As a result, he argued that the $525.00 claimed for this taxation should be disallowed.

[13] Mr. Grant referred to the Affidavit of Charlene Cho, sworn August 18, 2011, filed for use on this taxation, and in particular to Exhibits “G” and “H” to that Affidavit. Mr. Grant stated that these two exhibits were copies of letters forwarded to Mr. Palonek dated July 12 and August 3, 2011, enclosing the Respondent’s Bill of Costs. The last paragraph of each letter requested payment of the costs, failing which the matter would be scheduled for taxation.

[14] As payment of the Respondent’s costs was not received, the only means by which to settle the outstanding costs was to request the issuance of a Notice of Appointment to Tax Costs. As a result, I will allow the $525.00 claimed under Item 1(1)(c).

Item 1(2) – Transcripts

[15] Mr. Palonek submitted that the $620.00 claimed for the transcripts of the first two days of the hearing should be disallowed. He argued that a new lawyer assumed carriage of the file on behalf of the Respondent after the first two days of hearing, which was the reason why the transcripts were ordered. He further stated that he did not have the benefit of receiving copies of the transcript and should not be required to pay for them.

[16] Mr. Grant submitted that he referred to the transcripts during the last day of the hearing. Mr. Grant’s position was that the transcripts were essential for the conduct of the proceeding, the cost of which should be allowed.

[17] There was a four month delay between the commencement and conclusion of the hearing of Mr. Palonek’s appeals. While there was a change in counsel representing the Respondent during that four month interval, I am not convinced that was the only reason why transcripts of the first two days of the hearing were ordered. I do not find it unreasonable for counsel to have ordered transcripts of the first two days of the hearing, given the length of time between the adjournment and resumption of the hearing. In addition, my review of the transcript of the last day of the hearing revealed that the transcripts were referred to. I will accordingly allow the $620.00 claimed for transcripts under Item 1(2).

[18] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and I allow the sum of $7,745.98.

Signed at Toronto, Ontario, this 6th day of October 2011.
