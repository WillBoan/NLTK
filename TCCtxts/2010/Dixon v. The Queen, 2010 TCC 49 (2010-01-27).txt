HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR ORDER

Sheridan, J.

[1] At the hearing, after rendering my decision on the substantive issues of the Respondent’s motion, I deferred the Respondent’s request for the costs of this motion to the trial judge. Upon further reflection, however, I am satisfied that the Respondent’s request ought to be granted at this stage of the proceedings.

[2] In declining the Respondent’s request to dismiss the Appellant’s appeal for delay, I accepted the Appellant’s evidence that he missed the deadline for the filing of his List of Documents because he had confused the date set out in the Order of Tardif, J. (October 30, 2009) with the date the parties had proposed in their joint submission to the Court (October 31, 2009). As it turned out, October 31, 2009 was a Saturday; in keeping with its practice in such circumstances, the Court revised the proposed date to the week day immediately prior and issued the Order accordingly. At that point in the proceedings, the Appellant was self-represented.

[3] Having missed the October 30, 2009 deadline, the Appellant was advised that, under the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), he would not be permitted to file his List of Documents without first obtaining a new order to amend the dates in the Tardif Order. Instead of taking that step, the Appellant (who was represented by counsel for the purposes of the Respondent’s motion) coat-tailed his informal request for an extension of time to file his List of Documents onto the alternative relief sought in the Respondent’s motion to dismiss the Appellant’s appeal for delay. By employing this strategy, not only did the Appellant fail to comply with the Court’s direction but also effectively left to the Respondent the lion’s share of work that was ultimately to his benefit. And, it must be borne in mind, this occurred against the backdrop of his having failed to comply with the Tardif Order in the first place.

[4] For its part, the Crown’s written materials and oral submissions were very thoroughly prepared and well presented.

[5] In these circumstances, it seems only fair that the Appellant pay the costs of the Respondent’s motion.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 27th day of January, 2010.
