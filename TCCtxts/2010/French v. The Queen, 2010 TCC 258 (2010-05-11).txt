STEVE FRENCH,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR ORDER

Sheridan, J.

[1] The grounds for the Respondent’s motion are:

a) paragraphs 7, 9 and 11 of the Notice of Appeal contain allegations of fact that

a. may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the action;

b. are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; and

c. are an abuse of the process of the Court.

b) paragraphs 7, 9 and 11 of the Notice of Appeal contain allegations of fact concerning the Canada Revenue Agency’s process of assessing penalties against the Appellant under subsection 163(2) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the “ITA”) and the conduct and actions of a CRA official.

c) The process of an assessment and the conduct of CRA officials during that process are not relevant to any issues that are within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada, namely, the determination of the Appellant’s liability for penalties in accordance with the provisions of the ITA.

[2] The threshold for the striking out of pleadings is high. The jurisprudence is clear that, assuming the facts alleged can be proved, a pleading ought not to be struck out unless it is “plain and obvious” that it contains a radical defect that is certain to fail: Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc.[1].

[3] In the present case, I am not persuaded by the submissions of the Respondent that it is “plain and obvious” that the allegations made in paragraphs 7 and 9 pertain only to the misconduct of the Minister’s officials. I agree with the Appellant that they may be relevant to the determination of the validity of the penalties imposed by the Minister; in particular, to the timing of the assessment of the penalties as it relates to subsection 239(3) of the Income Tax Act.

[4] Paragraph 11, on the other hand, has only to do with the alleged misconduct of the officials; even if true, the allegations made do not provide a basis for allowing the appeal[2]. Accordingly, paragraph 11 of the Notice of Appeal shall be struck.

[5] The parties’ requests for costs are best left to the trial judge.

Signed at Winnipeg, Manitoba, this 11th day of May, 2010.
