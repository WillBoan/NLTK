REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, Taxing Officer, T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on July 19, 2011. It follows a Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Campbell dated August 11, 2010, wherein costs of the appeals of assessments made under the Income Tax Act for the 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 taxation years were awarded to the Respondent. The Appellant represented himself and Ms. Elizabeth (Lisa) MacDonald represented the Respondent.

[2] The counsel fees claimed on the Bill of Costs were $4,650.00. Mr. Pearce was not disputing the amounts claimed, but requested an explanation of several of the amounts claimed. Ms. MacDonald provided a detailed explanation to Mr. Pearce, which satisfied his concerns.

[3] The amounts claimed for counsel fees are in accordance with Schedule II Tariff B, and I will allow the amount claimed of $4,650.00.

[4] Disbursements claimed totalled $3,830.19. Mr. Pearce requested an explanation of the amount claimed for discovery transcripts. Upon Ms. MacDonald providing an explanation as to what the amount represented, Mr. Pearce indicated his acceptance of the amount claimed.

[5] Mr. Pearce stated that the $1,357.32 claimed for disbursements was extremely high and questioned the necessity of photocopying such a large number of documents, many of which were not referred to at the hearing.

[6] Ms. MacDonald stated that the amount claimed for photocopies represented amounts paid to third party suppliers to copy and bind documents. She further stated that the appeal involved expenses, necessitating the reproduction of many documents, the cost for which was recoverable on a taxation of costs.

[7] Copies of invoices to support the amount claimed for photocopies were attached as an exhibit to the Affidavit of Ruby Manget, filed for use on this taxation of costs. I am satisfied that the disbursement was incurred and was essential for the conduct of the proceeding. I will accordingly allow the full amount claimed for photocopies in the amount of $1,357.32, as well as all other amounts claimed for disbursements.

[8] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and the amount of $8,480.19 is allowed.

Signed at Toronto, Ontario, this 26th day of July, 2011.
