REASONS FOR TAXATION

Bruce Preston, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This matter came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on Thursday, March 4, 2010. It follows Judgments of the Honourable Justice Paris of this Court issued on June 18, 2008, dismissing the appeals, with one set of costs to the Respondent.

[2] The Appellant was represented by Mr. Paul E. Hawa, and the Respondent was represented by Mr. Ronald MacPhee.

[3] At the outset of the hearing counsel informed me that the matter was going on consent.

[4] Counsel for the Respondent informed me that the revised amount for disbursements was $12,367.69.

[5] Counsel for the Respondent further informed me that as the Taxation was going on consent, the amount of $700.00 under Item No. B1(1)(c) for the Taxation of Costs, was being removed from the Bill.

[6] I was further informed that the parties had agreed that the Bill of Costs of the Respondent be taxed and allowed at $22,517.00.

[7] For the above reasons, the Bill of Costs is taxed, and I allow the sum of $22,517.00.

Signed at Toronto, Ontario, this 5th day of March 2010.

Taxing Officer
