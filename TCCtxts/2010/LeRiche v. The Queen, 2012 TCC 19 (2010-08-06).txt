BETWEEN:

GORDON LERICHE,

Appellant,

and

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,

Respondent.

REASONS FOR ORDER

D'Arcy J.

[1] In my judgment, I allowed the appeal with costs. Subsequent to the issuance of the judgment, counsel for the Appellant filed a submission requesting the Court award costs in excess of the Tariff rate.

[2] The Appellant has requested the following costs:

- Fees from the commencement of the appeal to the decision at trial - $39,397.50

- GST of fees - $1,969.88

- Disbursements - $3,842.77

- Disbursements accounting fees - $9,577.50

- Fees for the cost submission - $750

[3] In her written submissions, the Respondent requested that the Court award costs (under the tariff) to the Respondent, or, in the alternative, that each party bear its own costs, or, in the further alternative, my judgment awarding costs to the Appellant in accordance with the tariff remain.

[4] As noted by this Court on numerous occasions, a trial judge has absolute and unfettered discretion to award or withhold costs subject only to the applicable rules on costs.

[5] Sections 147 to 152.1 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the “Rules”) contain the rules for awarding costs in general procedure appeals.

[6] When exercising its discretion, the Court may consider one or more of the elements listed in subsection 147(3) of the Rules, which reads as follows:

In exercising its discretionary power pursuant to subsection (1) the Court may consider,

(a) the result of the proceeding,

(b) the amounts in issue,

(c) the importance of the issues,

(d) any offer of settlement made in writing,

(e) the volume of work,

(f) the complexity of the issues,

(g) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding,

(h) the denial or the neglect or refusal or any party to admit anything that should have been admitted,

(i) whether any stage in the proceedings was,

(i) improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or

(ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution,

(j) any other matter relevant to the question of costs.

[7] In addition, pursuant to subsection 147(4) of the Rules, the Court may fix costs without reference to the Tariff contained in Schedule II of the Rules (the “Tariff”), and may award a lump sum in lieu of, or in addition to, any taxed costs.

[8] Paragraph 147(5)(c) of the Rules provides that the Court has the discretion to award costs on a solicitor and client basis. As noted by my colleague Justice Hogan in General Electric Capital Canada Inc. v. the Queen, 2010 TCC 490, 2010 D.T.C. 1353 (“General Electric”) at paragraphs 20 to 24, solicitor and client costs are only awarded in exceptional circumstances where there is evidence of reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct.

[9] Counsel for the Appellant states in his submission that the Appellant is asking for costs “in excess of the tariff rate.” However, it appears to me that the requested costs are on a solicitor and client basis. The table at page 11 of the submission appears to be claiming costs that represent 100% of the solicitor-client fees incurred.

[10] There is no evidence in this appeal of reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct that would allow for awarding of costs on a solicitor and client basis.

[11] I have also considered whether the Court should award party and party costs above the Tariff.

[12] This Court and the Federal Court of Appeal has considered, on numerous occasions, the issue of when the Court should award party and party costs above the Tariff. I agree with the approach taken by Justice Hogan in General Electric: the factors listed in subsection 147(3) of the Rules should be considered when determining whether to award party and party costs above the Tariff. Justice Hogan stated the following at paragraph 28 of his decision:

. . . It is reasonable to conclude that the purpose of section 147 of the Rules was to give a judge the discretion to move away from the Tariff in order to provide fair and reasonable relief in the circumstances — with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B.

[13] After considering the following factors in subsection 147(3), I have concluded that costs should be awarded to the Appellant in accordance with the Tariff, not above it:

1. In total, the Appellant obtained 60% of the amount sought. The amount at issue was $73,667. During the hearing, the Respondent consented to $15,892. In my judgment, I allowed an additional $27,212. While the fact that the Appellant obtained 60% of the amount sought justifies the awarding of costs, it does not support an award of costs above the Tariff rate.

2. The law in most of the relevant areas is fairly well settled. Further, the issues were not complex.

3. The Respondent made the only settlement offers. The last offer was for $25,775. This offer was for an amount that is substantially less than the amount obtained by the Appellant. It appears that the only “offer” made by the Appellant was for the amount at issue, $73,667.

4. In my view, the hearing should not have taken four days. The conduct of both counsel lengthened the hearing.

[14] For the foregoing reasons, the Court will not amend its Amended Judgment dated August 23, 2010 that awarded the Appellant costs in accordance with the Tariff.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of January 2012.
