(cc) all powers given to the appellant by the power of attorney of

February 9, 2000, actually represent all property rights involving specifically Pourvoirie Club Kergus as well as property rights involving share funds or any other security held by Marie‑Christine Perron. (admitted)

The only facts denied are as follows:

(x) the hours paid do not correspond with the hours actually worked by the

appellant; (denied)

(dd) the appellant was the directing mind of the payor’s corporation. (denied)

[3] The basis on which rests the determination under appeal is a notarized power of attorney, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit I‑1.

[4] The content of the notarized power of attorney clearly demonstrates the breadth of the powers held by the appellant. In fact, the power of attorney conferred on the appellant all the rights and powers conferred by the shares issued by the company and held by her on behalf of the appellant’s daughter.

[5] There is no doubt that the appellant had both de jure and de facto control over all the rights arising out of all of the shares held on behalf of her daughter, Marie‑Christine Perron.

[6] The documentary evidence therefore established that the basis on which rests the determination, that is, that the appellant held control over more than 40% of the shares, is valid. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed, even though the appellant stated that her daughter was involved and actively participated in managing the company.

[7] She explained that her daughter had a professional career that often caused her to be physically absent. She also mentioned that the power of attorney had been signed prior to a trip to Europe.

[8] The evidence established that the content of the power of attorney had never been amended.

[9] The appellant would like the Court to accept explanations that are essentially verbal to contradict a valid written document that was duly drafted by a notary and signed in his presence and is, moreover, still in force. However, not only did the appellant contradict the content of the power of attorney, the person who assigned to the appellant her rights to manage the company was conspicuously absent from the hearing.

[10] Such evidence is simply not acceptable or satisfactory and does not make it possible to set aside the content of a document that is not only formal, but also very clear.

[11] It is crucial in such matters to attach prime importance to the content of a formal document signed in the presence of a disinterested notary rather than to accept verbal explanations provided by an interested party, particularly if such explanations contradict the written document.

[12] The power of attorney clearly stipulates that the appellant had the inherent right and power to hold 100% of the shares with holding rights. In other words, the appellant held all powers related to the shares, with an individual share ownership above 40%, that is, 100 %. Furthermore, all the assumed facts which prove or confirm the appellant’s powers were recognized by the appellant.

[13] I note the content of the allegations admitted–paragraphs h, s and z, all of which confirm the appellant’s powers.

[14] For these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of October 2010.
