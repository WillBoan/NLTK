REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on February 17, 2012. It follows a Judgment of the Honourable Justice Paris dated March 29, 2011, dismissing the appeal under the Income Tax Act, with costs. Two unsuccessful attempts to contact the Appellant were made. The Taxation of Costs proceeded thirty minutes after the appointed time, without the participation of the Appellant. Mr. Eric Douglas represented the Respondent.

[2] The counsel fees claimed in the amount of $4,150.00 were in accordance with the Tariff. The disbursements claimed were supported by receipts and I am satisfied that they were essential for the conduct of the appeal. I will allow the full amount claimed for counsel fees and disbursements.

[3] The Bill of Costs is taxed and $4,927.23 is allowed. A Certificate in that amount will be issued.

Signed at Toronto, Ontario, this 28th day of February, 2012.
