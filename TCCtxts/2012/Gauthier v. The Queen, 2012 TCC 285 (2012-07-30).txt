REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] The taxation of the Respondentâ€™s Bill of Costs came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on July 25, 2012. It followed a Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Woods issued on February 28, 2012. The taxation of costs proceeded thirty minutes after the appointed time, without the participation of the Appellant. The Respondent was represented by Mr. Gregory Perlinski.

[2] The counsel fees claimed on the Bill of Costs were in accordance with the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and are allowed in the full amount of 3,404.48, which includes $700.00 on account of the taxation of costs.

[3] I am satisfied that the disbursements claimed were essential for the conduct and the amount claimed of $154.48 is allowed.

[4] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and $3,404.48 is allowed.

Signed at Toronto, Canada, this 30th day of July 2012.
