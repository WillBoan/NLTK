ORDER AND REASONS FOR ORDER

[1] On the Appellant’s motion to strike, on December 21, 2011, the Court ordered that portions of the four Replies in question be struck because they were prejudicial and/or an abuse of process, conclusions of mixed fact and law, scandalous, not material facts, or evidence (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 568). The Court rejected the Appellant’s argument that the Court should strike references to the “egregious or repulsive" concept.

[2] The Order specified the text struck from the Reply in 2010‑1414(IT)G, and held that these strikes should be applied mutatis mutandis to the Replies in appeals 2010-1413(IT)G, 2010-1640(IT)G, and 2010-2864(IT)G. The Respondent was ordered to provide draft Amended Replies to the Court within 60 days for the Court to review for compliance and then issue any further Order, as required.

[3] Both parties appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal, but to date, neither party has requested a suspension of operation of the Judgment under rule 172(2) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure).

[4] The Respondent has submitted a single draft Amended Reply for appeal 2010-1414(IT)G as a model, with the intention to then amend the three other replies, as required, in compliance with the Court’s assessment as outlined in this Order.

[5] Upon reviewing the draft Amended Reply, Appellant’s counsel informed the Court that he believes it is materially non-compliant with the December 21, 2011 Order.

[6] Both parties were invited to provide submissions regarding the compliance of the draft Amended Reply and each party did so.

[7] After reviewing each party’s submissions and the draft Amended Reply in detail, the Court determines that the text ordered struck has been removed from the draft Amended Reply. Where ordered, the Respondent also condensed or deleted text to eliminate pleadings determined by the Court’s Order to be evidence or non-material facts.

[8] Some of the text deemed by the December 21, 2011 Order to be prejudicial, and/or scandalous, an abuse of process, or conclusions of mixed fact and law has been replaced with new text in the draft Amended Reply. Significant portions of this new text do not comply with the Court’s previous Order. A number of the substituted terms are near synonyms with the phrases previously struck. Several of the additional paragraphs are replete with conclusions of mixed fact and law concerning both Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce [“CIBC”] and a third party and place an unfair onus on CIBC; they are prejudicial and an abuse of process.

[9] The Court orders that all text identified in the table below as not complying with the Court’s December 11, 2011 Order is struck. In addition, the Court accepts any proposals from the Respondent to delete paragraphs with duplicative text.

[10] The Respondent shall file with the Court, within 30 days, four final Amended Replies in each of the appeals, 2010-1413(IT)G, 2010-1414(IT)G, 2010-1640(IT)G, and 2010-2864(IT)G, in compliance with this Order and this Court’s previous Order issued December 21, 2011. Given the partial success of both parties with respect to their arguments before the Court, there will be no order as to costs.
