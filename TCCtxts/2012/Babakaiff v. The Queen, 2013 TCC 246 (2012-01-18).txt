REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, Taxing Officer, T.C.C.

[1] This taxation came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on June 26, 2013. It followed a Judgment of the Honourable Justice Hogan dated January 18, 2012, dismissing the appeal from an assessment made pursuant to subsection 323(1) of the Excise Tax Act, with costs. The Appellant did not participate in this taxation of costs. Ms. Shannon Fenrich represented the Respondent.

[2] The counsel fees claimed are in accordance with Schedule II, Tariff B of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and are allowed in the amount of $5,700.00, which includes $700.00 for this taxation of costs. The disbursements claimed were supported by copies of invoices attached as Exhibits to the Affidavit of Olinda Samuel, sworn March 18, 2013, filed in support of this taxation of costs. I am satisfied that the disbursements claimed were necessary for the conduct of the proceeding and they are allowed in the amount of $650.54.

[3] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and the amount of $6,340.54 is allowed.
