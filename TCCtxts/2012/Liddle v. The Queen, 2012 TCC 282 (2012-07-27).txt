REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] The taxation of the Respondentâ€™s Bill of Costs came on for hearing by way of a telephone conference call on June 27, 2012. It followed a Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Campbell issued on September 11, 2009, wherein the Respondent was awarded costs. The Appellant represented himself and Ms. Justine Malone represented the Respondent.

[2] Mr. Liddle stated that he was not opposing any of the amounts claimed for counsel fees and disbursements on the Bill of Costs.

[3] The counsel fees claimed on the Bill of Costs were in accordance with the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and are allowed in the full amount of $700.00.

[4] I am satisfied that the disbursement for photocopies of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal was a necessary disbursement for the conduct of the proceeding and the amount claimed of $5.00 is allowed.

[5] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and $705.00 is allowed.

Signed at Toronto, Canada, this 27th day of July 2012.
