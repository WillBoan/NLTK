REASONS FOR TAXATION

Barbara Tanasychuk, T.O., T.C.C.

[1] The taxation of costs of the Respondent’s Bill of Costs was held on October 23, 2012, by conference call. It followed a Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Woods dated September 17, 2010. That judgment dismissed appeals of assessments made under the Income Tax Act and Excise Tax Act and awarded costs to the Respondent in respect of the appeal under the Income Tax Act. The Appellant was represented by Mr. Kevin D. Mah and Ms. Margaret Irving represented the Respondent.

[2] Mr. Mah stated that he had been unable to communicate with his client, but confirmed that a copy of the Bill of Costs had been provided to her. He further stated that he was taking no position with respect to the Respondent’s Bill of Costs.

[3] Ms. Irving stated that there was nothing unusual about the Bill of Costs. She submitted that the amounts claimed were in accordance with the Tariff.

[4] I have reviewed the Bill of Costs. The amounts claimed for counsel fees are in accordance with Schedule II, Tariff B of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) and are allowed in the amount of $4,825.00. I am satisfied that the disbursements claimed were necessary for the conduct of the proceeding and the amount of $535.29 is allowed.

[5] The Bill of Costs of the Respondent is taxed and $5,360.29 is allowed.

Signed at Toronto, Canada, this 30th day of October 2012.
