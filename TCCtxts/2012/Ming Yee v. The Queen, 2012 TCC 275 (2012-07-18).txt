REASONS FOR ORDER

Lamarre, J.

[1] On April 24, 2012, the applicants filed an application for an extension of time to file notices of appeal from the most recent assessments made by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) for 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.

[2] The most recent assessments for those years are dated May 19, 2011. They are the result of this Court's judgment, rendered by Justice Archambault, dated January 26, 2011. The applicants did not appeal that decision.

[3] Through their agent, Li Han Tcheng, the applicants, also applied for relief to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) under subsection 152(4.2) of the Income Tax Act (ITA), requesting to be reassessed after the normal assessment period for the 2000 to 2008 taxation years. I understand Li Han Tcheng's explanations that he is dissatisfied with the CRA's decision regarding these applications.

[4] Our Court does not have jurisdiction to review the CRA's decisions with respect to these applications because, for the purposes of subsection 169(1) of the ITA, our Court can hear only appeals from assessments for which taxpayers must first file a notice of objection under section 165 of the ITA. Under subsection 165(1.2) of the ITA, no objection may be made by a taxpayer to an assessment made under subsection 152(4.2) of the ITA. (See Groulx v. The Queen, 2008 CCI 445 (CanLII).)

[5] The same reasoning applies to any application for relief made to the CRA in order that it waive penalties and interest, in accordance with the fairness provisions in subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA. (See Palin v. The Queen, 2007 CCI 255 (CanLII).)

[6] Accordingly, the applicants cannot appeal to our Court from any assessment resulting from a decision rendered following an application for relief to the CRA. The applicants may challenge such a decision of the CRA with an application for judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada. (See Palin, supra.)

[7] In addition, I cannot allow the application for an extension of time to appeal from the assessments dated May 19, 2011, in accordance with the judgment of Justice Archambault. That decision was not appealed, and this constitutes res judicata. The appeal from these assessments is not based on reasonable grounds.

[8] The applications for an extension of time are dismissed.

Signed at Ottawa, Canada, this 26th day of July 2012.
