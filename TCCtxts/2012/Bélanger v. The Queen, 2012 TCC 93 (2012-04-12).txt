[6] At the beginning of the hearing, the appellant conceded the following:

(a) the profit on the sale of the two properties located at 584–586 Iris and 505 Du Rubis in 2004 should have been reported as business income;

(b) the profit on the sale of the two properties located at 501 Du Rubis and 498 Du Topaze in 2005 should have been reported as business income; and

(c) the capital cost allowance claimed for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 taxation years was properly disallowed, except as regards the five properties making up Place Montrose.

[7] Daniel Bélanger testified at the hearing. He explained that the five Montrose Place properties were located on two adjacent lots and had a common exterior parking lot as well as an exterior garage with four 12 by 22 foot doors, which was rented out separately. Each property had twelve 1,200 square foot, two-bedroom apartments on three floors.

[8] Mr. Bélanger also explained that in 2002 he acquired the two lots and the abandoned textile plant that was already there. He had to demolish the plant and decontaminate the ground before undertaking the construction of the five buildings in 2003 and 2004. The site was ideal for tenants aged 50 years and over without children as it was located in close proximity to the hospital, the CLSC, a pharmacy, a supermarket, churches and restaurants.

[9] Mr. Bélanger stated that he did not build the five buildings with a view to reselling them. His intention was to keep them to generate income for his retirement and that of his spouse, Lynda Roy. The properties were well situated and easily rentable. The clientele was easy to manage and satisfy and they were always good payers. The properties had a very low vacancy rate and there was a waiting list for the apartments, which were rented at $625 per month.

[10] Mr. Bélanger stated at the hearing that he changed his plans owing to his separation from Ms. Roy, which occurred in February 2006, that is, after the sale of the Montrose Place properties on June 6, 2005. According to Mr. Bélanger’s testimony, his ex-wife managed the Place Montrose rental properties, which involved showing the apartments, having the leases signed, and depositing the monthly rental payments into Mr. Bélanger’s personal bank account. As the separation resulted in the loss of the resource person who was managing the rental properties and since he himself did not have the time to take care of the day-to-day management of 60 dwelling units, he abandoned his first intention and decided to sell the Place Montrose properties.

[11] According to Mr. Bélanger, the five Place Montrose properties were sold to Adrien Gagné following an unsolicited offer from him. No mandate to sell the properties was given to a real estate agent by Mr. Bélanger and no sales commission was paid by him to any real estate agent. Mr. Gagné was at that time commercial accounts manager at the Caisse Populaire Desjardins de Granby. The appellant had known him for years and lived near him. At the hearing, Mr. Bélanger indicated that about one and a half months prior to the sale he had received a call from Mr. Gagné, who inquired whether the Place Montrose properties were for sale. He said that Mr. Gagné offered him $4,475,000 and that the municipal assessment was about $4,500,000. The sale en bloc of the five properties was finalized on June 6, 2005, for a purchase price of $4,475,000, of which $1,200,000 was paid in cash or with secured commercial paper, $2,450,000 was financed by a mortgage loan from the Caisse Populaire Desjardins de Granby secured by a first mortgage on the properties, and the balance of about $800,000 was financed by a mortgage loan from Gestion DB secured by a second mortgage on the properties.

[12] The five Place Montrose properties were built by Constructions Horizon Inc. on behalf of the appellant. The construction of three out of the five buildings was completed in 2003 and the construction of the other two was completed in 2004. The three buildings built in 2003 were held for 23 months and the two built in 2004 were held for 12 months. The appellant made a profit of $800,330 on the sale of said properties.

[13] Daniel Morin, a real estate agent with the Sutton Group, and Sylvain Dupont, a carpenter and an employee of Constructions Horizon Inc., testified at the hearing on behalf of the appellant. The two men have in common the fact that they purchased properties from the appellant before and after the Place Montrose project and the fact that they both solicited the appellant with regard to the acquisition of the Place Montrose properties. The interest of each went back to the beginning of the construction of the Place Montrose properties. The two groups of potential purchasers were told by the appellant that the properties were not for sale and that he wanted to keep them for his retirement.

[14] Chantal Labbé, an auditor with the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA), also testified at the hearing. Her audit report, dated September 4, 2007, was filed as Exhibit I-6 and appended thereto was a document entitled [Translation] “Report on capital gains vs. business income of Daniel Bélanger for 2004-2005-2006.” The document attached to the report relies heavily on the facts obtained from Lynda Roy during an interview conducted in August 2007.

[15] In particular, that document reveals that Lynda Roy lost her father to cancer on February 19, 2006. The first time she heard anything about a separation was a few days prior to her father’s death, that is, early in February 2006. She confirmed that there had never been any talk of separation in 2005 and that everything was fine between them. After her father’s death, everything happened quickly. A little more than two months later, the divorce agreement was signed before Mr. Poitras in Granby on April 27, 2006. The divorce was granted on May 3, 2006, and registered on June 6 before the Honourable Justice Pierre Boily.

[16] Lynda Roy confirmed that the separation from Mr. Bélanger had nothing to do with the sale of the Place Montrose properties as, at the time, separation was not being discussed.

[17] Lynda Roy also said that Mr. Bélanger did not keep her informed of all his property purchases and sales. Much of the time, she would find out once the transaction was completed. Concerning the properties at issue in this case, Mr. Bélanger told her that he had sold them owing to the looming recession, that he needed money to purchase other land and that he wanted her to take it easy as she was the one managing the properties, that is, meeting tenants with regard to the leases and collecting the rent. She said she was surprised that Mr. Bélanger had sold the properties as she loved the Place Montrose clientele.

[18] Lynda Roy confirmed that she had continued managing Mr. Bélanger’s properties until early March 2006, filling out and signing all the deposit slips. On March 9, 2006, Lynda Roy ceased altogether managing Mr. Bélanger’ properties.

[19] Following the sale of the Place Montrose properties on June 6, 2005, Lynda Roy and Mr. Bélanger went on a trip together to Italy for a convention of the APCHQ, which was held from October 6 to 17, 2005, and Lynda Roy continued to sign cheques for payments made to the subcontractors working on the new residence at 163 Du Diamant, Granby, into which Lynda Roy and her spouse moved around December 2005.

[20] Lynda Roy did not testify at the hearing, but Mr. Bélanger did not contest her version of the facts.

. . .

Analysis

[22] Since the Act contains no provision clarifying the circumstances in which gains from the sale of real property are to be considered as business income or as a capital gain, the courts have developed a number of factors to take into account all particular fact situations. A non-exhaustive list of those factors is provided in paragraph 3 of Interpretation Bulletin IT-218R dated September 16, 1986:

(d) extent to which intention carried out by the taxpayer;

and associates;

acquisition and the terms of the financing, if any, arranged;

(k) factors which motivated the sale of the real estate;

[23] None of those factors is conclusive in itself for the purpose of determining whether a gain from the sale of real estate constitutes business income or a capital gain. However, the most important factor is the taxpayer's subjective intention with respect to the property at the time the taxpayer acquired it (“primary intention”).

[24] To those factors must be added the “secondary intention” criterion, which was developed by the courts to take into account circumstances in which the taxpayer's “primary intention” to own the property as an investment was thwarted and in which the taxpayer had the possibility of selling the property for a profit in the event that the taxpayer’s investment project did not come to fruition.

[25] The analysis of the taxpayer’s “primary intention” and “secondary intention” is a question of fact. In this regard, the circumstances surrounding the holding and disposition of a property must be analyzed by the courts, in addition to the taxpayer’s statements of intention.

The context

[26] The appellant is a building contractor who has been operating since at least 1993. His business is based on a well-structured and well-established business plan. Gestion DB purchased the lots and the appellant had Horizon build the apartment buildings. Once the construction of a building was completed, Horizon sold the property to the appellant in his personal capacity at a price equal to its fair market value, as determined by the report of an accredited appraiser. Once acquired by the appellant, the property was put up for rent until 75% occupancy was reached, which is the minimum required for banks to be able to provide mortgage funds. To facilitate the sale of the properties, Gestion DB provided the purchasers with second mortgage financing to cover the portion of the purchase price representing the down payment required by the banks. The context in which the Place Montrose properties were built was indeed a business context.

[27] According to the appellant, the purpose for which the apartment buildings were built was to keep his construction business going and provide work for his men so as not to lose them. For him, it was very important to retain his qualified workers and provide work for his dependable men, with whom he had worked for over ten years. The properties are offered for rent prior to being sold because they sell more easily once they are rented than when they are empty.

[28] From 2001 to 2007, the appellant personally had his construction company build 36 apartment buildings and he only kept one of these for a period of more than two years. An analysis of the 36 transactions revealed that the criterion used by the appellant in determining the tax treatment of the income from the sale of a property was the amount of time the property was held. If it was for a period of less than one year, the income was considered to be business income, whereas if the property was held for more than one year, the income was considered to be a capital gain. In many cases, the holding period exceeded one year owing to the time required to rent the property (leasing delay).

The appellant’s intention at the time of acquiring the Montrose plant

[29] According to the appellant, his intention at the time he purchased the Montrose plant and the subjacent land was to put up the five buildings with a view to keeping them long-term as a pension fund for himself. Among the reasons cited by the appellant for retaining ownership of those properties longer than he did with the others are the following:

- the geographical location of the five properties, that is, near the hospital, a CLSC, a shopping mall, a restaurant and a supermarket; the area was ideal for seniors;

- the target clientele was mainly composed of retirees, who are good payers and are easy to manage and not hard to please.

The plausibility of the taxpayer’s primary intention

[30] According to the appraisal reports for the five properties of Place Montrose, those properties did not meet the specific standards for housing seniors, such as an elevator, handrails in the hallways, wider hallways and air conditioning.

[31] Even if the Place Montrose properties were not designed more for seniors, the auditor did not deny that the appellant’s primary intention may have been to keep those properties long-term to ensure a pension income for himself.

[32] The appellant’s assertions in that regard were confirmed by the testimony of Daniel Morin and Sylvain Dupont, and by Ms. Roy during her interview with the auditor.

The appellant’s secondary intention

[33] Given his experience in construction and his knowledge of the Granby real estate market, the appellant was very well aware, when he acquired the Montrose plant, that it would be easy to find a buyer for his buildings if he should want to dispose of them. The geographical location of Place Montrose and the clientele sought made the project very attractive for prospective buyers. Indeed, the appellant received numerous calls from potential buyers, including Daniel Morin and Sylvain Dupont, while the buildings were under construction.

[34] The circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the Montrose plant and the construction of Place Montrose suggest that there was little likelihood that the properties would be held long-term by the appellant not because of a lack of financial resources on his part but rather because it was out of line with his usual business plan. It should be noted that, since 2001, the appellant has sold 36 properties and has only kept one property for over two years.

Motivating factors in selling the properties

[35] The appellant maintained that he changed his plans only because of his separation from Ms. Roy, yet she knew nothing of a separation. She only found out that Mr. Bélanger wanted to separate in early February 2006, a few days before her father’s death.

[36] According to the appellant, his sole reason for selling was his separation from Ms. Roy, which meant the loss of the resource person who looked after all aspects of the management of the five properties. As the appellant had to devote 80 hours per week to his construction company, he had no time for the management of the five Place Montrose properties.

[37] The explanation provided by the appellant seems to me to be implausible given the time lag between the appellant’s deciding to sell the five properties en bloc in April 2005 (approximately 1½ months before the date of the sale) and his informing his wife that he wanted to separate, in early February 2006, and considering what happened in the interval, namely, the couple’s move in December 2005 into their new residence at 163 Rue Du Diamant in Granby, the couple’s trip to Italy in October 2005 and the fact that Ms. Roy continued to pay the new residence’s suppliers and continued as well to manage Mr. Bélanger's properties until March 9, 2006.

[38] The appellant did not provide any evidence to demonstrate that he took any actions or steps to retain ownership of the Place Montrose properties or to find another person or company to take care of the management of those properties. The CRA auditor noted in the document attached to the audit report the appellant’s response to the question as to why he did not think of hiring someone to replace Ms. Roy.

[Translation]

He replied that he was overwhelmed at the time and had to find a solution quickly, that he was spent, that his mind was elsewhere with everything that was happening in his personal life and that he could not see how he would get through it all.

[39] In fact, the person who replaced Ms. Roy as of March 9, 2006, was Mr. Bélanger’s sister, Christine Bélanger. She officially commenced her duties as an employee of Horizon in March 2006. She had previously provided her services to Horizon as a subcontractor, handling the bookkeeping and government remittances. When the appellant decided to sell the Place Montrose properties, he knew or ought to have known that he could count on his sister to replace Ms. Roy as she was already familiar with her brother’s business operations.

[40] The facts introduced in evidence show that the couple separated in March 2006. It is difficult to believe that in April or June 2005 the sole reason for the sale of the Place Montrose properties was the eventual separation from Ms. Roy when there is nothing in the facts to suggest there were any signs of a separation and the other person concerned, Ms. Roy, did not have any knowledge at all of a potential separation.

[41] The appellant did not disclose to his ex-wife the real reasons for selling the Place Montrose properties. He told her that a recession was imminent and that he needed money for other transactions and to purchase other land. Therefore, he kept the truth from her.

[42] It is important to emphasize here that the appellant changed his primary intention as a result of his own decision and not because he was unable to carry out his project for any reason. He even facilitated the sale by granting the purchaser a loan in the amount of $800,000 secured by a second mortgage on the Place Montrose properties. In my view, this shows that the sale of the Place Montrose properties was consistent with the appellant’s business plan and his modus operandi. The transaction took place in a business context.

[43] On the basis of the facts introduced in evidence, I can only conclude that the appellant had an unspoken secondary intention which was to sell for a profit at the first opportunity. The Place Montrose project was not any different from the appellant’s other development projects. The amount of time the properties were held was only 23 months for the three buildings built in 2003 and just 12 months for the other two, which were built in 2004.

[44] For these reasons, the Minister was justified in recharacterizing the capital gain reported of $800,330 as business income for the 2005 taxation year and in disallowing the capital cost allowance claimed by the appellant in respect of the Place Montrose properties for the 2004 taxation year.

[45] Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with costs.
